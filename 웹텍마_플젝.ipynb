exhibition  The Caroline County Art  Contest has had over one hundred artworks submitted to us by  local artists  For the theme  we wanted artists to explore the  natural world of Caroline County  I believe the Garden Caf   Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event  as your  gallery is well known for its beautiful garden  The exhibition  is usually held throughout October  and we very much hope  that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Caf   Gallery during this time  I look forward to your response   Yours sincerely  Sophia Willis                                                                                                                                 Annette                    The day of the Five Mile Fun Walk had arrived  Annette had  been waiting for Reiner at the registration point for over an hour   There was still no sign of him  She started thinking that  something bad might have happened to him  Getting concerned   she tried calling Reiner s phone again  but there was no  response  At that moment  she heard a voice calling her name   She found Reiner coming toward her   Thank goodness  What  happened   she asked  He explained that the traffic had been  terrible  What was worse  he had left his phone at home   I m so  sorry   he said  She started to relax   I m fine now  As long as  you re here and safe  Why don t we go and register   They  headed into the event together    worried   relieved   confident   nervous   calm   upset   regretful   grateful   bored   amazed                                   Given the right conditions  entrepreneurship can be fully  woven into the fabric of campus life  greatly expanding its  educational reach  One study showed that  within the workplace   peers influence each other to spot opportunities and act on  them  the more entrepreneurs you have working together in an  office  the more likely their colleagues will catch the bug  A  study of Stanford University alumni found that those  who  have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more  likely to start their own businesses than those who have  focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at  school   To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture  colleges and  universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences  and wide exposure to different ideas  They are uniquely  positioned to do

figure  things out while they re happening  It s therefore not a surprise  when a restaurant server offers you a menu  When she brings  you a glass with a clear fluid in it  you don t have to ask if

life  and young children are very much  a part of this multifaceted fabric  The musical experiences they  have provide opportunities for them to know language   behaviors  customs  traditions  beliefs  values  stories  and other  cultural nuances  As they become musically skilled through  experiences in song and instrumental music  young children can  also grow cultural knowledge and sensitivity  Music is an  extremely important aspect of culture  shaping and transmitting  the above mentioned aspects that characterize groups of people   Exposing young children to the world s musical cultures brings  them into the cultural conversation  allowing them to learn about  self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way   Prior to the development of social biases and cultural preferences  that all too easily turn into prejudices  the opportunity to know  people through song  dance  and instrument play is a gift to all  who work for the well balanced development of young children  into the responsible citizens they will one day become    tapestry                       multifaceted

from Plato to Descartes  credits individuals and especially  geniuses with creativity and originality  Social and cultural  influences and causes are minimized  ignored  or eliminated  from consideration at all  Thoughts  original and conventional   are identified with individuals  and the special things that  individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains   The  trick  here is to recognize that individual humans are social  constructions themselves  embodying and reflecting the variety  of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to  during their lives  Our individuality is not denied  but it is viewed  as a product of specific social and cultural experiences  The brain  itself is a social thing  influenced structurally and at the level  of its connectivities by social environments  The  individual   is a legal  religious  and political fiction just as the  I  is a  grammatical illusion     recognition of the social nature inherent in

humbling and perhaps a  calming effect upon the soul of modern man  The nineteenth  century  as we have observed  was the last to believe that the  world  as a whole as well as in its parts  could ever be  perfectly known  We realize now that this is  and always was   impossible  We know within limits  not absolutely  even if the  limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs  Curiously   from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge  and appear to be attainable  Even if we cannot know the world  with absolute precision  we can still control it  Even our  inherently incomplete knowledge seems to work as powerfully  as ever  In short  we may never know precisely how high is the  highest mountain  but we continue to be certain that we can  get to the top

Marc Isambard Brunel                            Marc Isambard Brunel             is best known for the  design and construction of the Thames Tunnel  Originally  born in France  Brunel escaped to the United States during the  French Revolution  He later moved to London  When the  Napoleonic Wars were at their height  he invented machines  for making boots  During the Napoleonic Wars  Brunel s  factory supplied British troops with boots  After the Wars  ended  however  the government stopped buying his boots and  he went out of business  A few years later  Brunel was  imprisoned for several months because of his debt  At that  time  London was very much divided by the River Thames  and needed more ways for people and goods to move across it   In       Brunel designed a tunnel under the river  The Thames  Tunnel officially opened on    March       and Brunel   despite being in ill health  attended the opening ceremony

Competitive activities can be more than just performance  showcases   which the best is recognized and the rest are  overlooked  The provision of timely  constructive feedback to  participants on performance  is an asset that some competitions  and contests offer  In a sense  all competitions give feedback   For many  this is restricted to information about whether the  participant is an award  or prizewinner  The provision of that  type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to  demonstrating superior performance but not   necessarily  excellence  The best competitions promote excellence  not just  winning or  beating  others  The emphasis on superiority is  what we typically see as   fostering a detrimental effect of  competition  Performance feedback requires that the program  go beyond the  win  place  or show  level of feedback   Information about performance can be very helpful  not only  to the participant who does not win or place but also to those  who   do    foster           detrimental                                                    If I say to you   Don t think of a white bear   you will find it  difficult not to think of a white bear  In this way   thought  suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to  suppress instead of calming them   One common example of  this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food  often begin to think much   more about food  This process is  therefore also known as the rebound effect  The   ironic  effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related  cognitive processes  This dual process system involves  first   an intentional operating process  which consciously attempts to  locate thoughts   unrelated to the suppressed ones  Second   and simultaneously  an unconscious monitoring process tests  whether the operating system is functioning effectively  If the  monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the  intended ones  it prompts the intentional operating process to  ensure that these are replaced by   inappropriate thoughts   However  it is argued  the intentional operating system can fail  due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue  stress and  emotional factors  and so the monitoring process filters the  inappropriate thoughts into consciousness  making them  highly   accessible                                             What s in a name  That which we call a rose  by any other  name would smell as sweet   This thought of Shakespeare s  points up a difference between roses and  say  paintings   Natural objects  such as roses  are not   They are  not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages  They belong  to no tradition  strictly speaking have no style  and are not  understood within a framework of culture and convention   Rather  they are sensed and savored relatively directly  without  intellectual mediation  and so what they are called  either  individually or collectively  has little bearing on our experience  of them  What a work of art is titled  on the other hand  has a  significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the  qualities we correctly perceive in it  A painting of a rose  by a  name other than the one it has  might very well smell different   aesthetically speaking  The painting titled Rose of Summer and  an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are  physically  but also semantically and aesthetically  distinct  objects of art    savor           indiscernible               semantically          changed   classified   preserved   controlled   interpreted     Genetic engineering followed by cloning to distribute many  identical animals or plants is sometimes seen as a threat to the  diversity of nature  However  humans have been replacing  diverse natural habitats with artificial monoculture for millennia   Most natural habitats in the advanced nations have already been  replaced with some form of artificial environment based on mass  production or repetition  The real threat to biodiversity is surely  the need to convert ever more of our planet into production  zones to feed the ever increasing human population  The cloning  and transgenic alteration of domestic animals makes little  difference to the overall situation  Conversely  the renewed  interest in genetics has led to a growing awareness that there  are many wild plants and animals with interesting or useful  genetic properties that could be used for a variety of  as yet unknown purposes  This has led in turn to a realization  that       because they may harbor tomorrow s drugs against cancer   malaria  or obesity    monoculture          ecological systems are genetically programmed   we should avoid destroying natural ecosystems   we need to stop creating genetically modified organisms   artificial organisms can survive in natural environments   living things adapt themselves to their physical environments                                           Since human beings are at once both similar and different  they  should be treated equally because of both  Such a view  which  grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of  uniformity and difference  builds difference into the very concept  of equality  breaks the traditional equation of equality with  similarity  and is immune to monist distortion  Once the basis of  equality changes so does its content  Equality involves equal  freedom or opportunity to be different  and treating human beings  equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and  differences  When the latter are not relevant  equality entails  uniform or identical treatment  when they are  it requires  differential treatment  Equal rights do not mean identical rights   for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs  might in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights   Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is  commonly argued  but also full recognition of legitimate and  relevant ones         monist           entail         require different rights to enjoy equality   abandon their own freedom for equality   welcome the identical perception of inequality   accept their place in the social structure more easily   reject relevant differences to gain full understanding     Protopia is a state of becoming  rather than a destination  It  is a process  In the protopian mode  things are better today  than they were yesterday  although only a little better  It is  incremental improvement or mild progress  The  pro  in  protopian stems from the notions of process and progress  This  subtle progress is not dramatic  not exciting  It is easy to miss  because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as  new benefits  The problems of today were caused by  yesterday s technological successes  and the technological  solutions to today s problems will cause the problems of  tomorrow  This circular expansion of both problems and  solutions Ever since the Enlightenment and the invention of science     we ve managed to create a tiny bit more than we ve destroyed  each year  But that few percent positive difference is  compounded over decades into what we might call civilization   Its benefits never star in movies         incremental          compound         conceals the limits of innovations at the present time   makes it difficult to predict the future with confidence   motivates us to quickly achieve a protopian civilization    hides a steady accumulation of small net benefits over time   produces a considerable change in technological successes                              In a highly commercialized setting such as the United  States  it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as  commodities  In other words  they are valued because of their  market potential  Residents develop an identity in part based  on how the landscape can generate income for the community    This process involves more than the conversion of the  natural elements into commodities    The landscape itself   including the people and their sense of self  takes on the form  of a commodity    Landscape protection in the US traditionally  focuses on protecting areas of wilderness  typically in  mountainous regions    Over time  the landscape identity can  evolve into a sort of  logo  that can be used to sell the stories  of the landscape    Thus  California s  Wine Country    Florida s  Sun Coast   or South Dakota s  Badlands  shape  how both outsiders and residents perceive a place  and these  labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of  those who live there                                                    In the fifth century B C E   the Greek philosopher  Protagoras pronounced   Man is the measure of all things    In other words  we feel entitled to ask the world   What  good are you    A  Abilities  said  to   make  us  human    empathy   communication  grief  toolmaking  and so on   all exist to  varying degrees among other minds sharing the world with  us  Animals with backbones  fishes  amphibians  reptiles   birds  and mammals  all share the same basic skeleton   organs  nervous systems  hormones  and behaviors   B  We assume that we are the world s standard  that all things  should be compared to us  Such an assumption makes us  overlook a lot   C  Just as different models of automobiles each have an  engine  drive train  four wheels  doors  and seats  we  differ mainly in terms of our outside contours and a few  internal tweaks  But like naive car buyers  most people  see only animals  varied exteriors    contour             tweak            A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C

archival institution    A  The best archival decisions about art do not focus on  territoriality  this object belongs in my institution even  though I do not have the resources to care for it  or on  questions of monetary value or prestige  this object raises  the cultural standing of my institution   The best decisions  focus on what evidential value exists and what is best for  the item   B  But art can also carry aesthetic value  which elevates the  job of evaluation into another realm  Aesthetic value and  the notion of artistic beauty are important considerations   but they are not what motivates archival preservation in  the first instance   C  Art can serve as documentary evidence  especially when  the items were produced before photography became  common  Sketches of soldiers on a battlefield  paintings of  English country villages or portraits of Dutch townspeople  can provide the only visual evidence of a long ago place   person or time         archival               prestige

copies before completing  this process  you will know that you have a sufficient  number to go around    We sometimes solve number problems almost without  realizing it        For example  suppose you are conducting  a meeting and you want to ensure that everyone there has a  copy of the agenda        You can deal with this by labelling  each copy of the handout in turn with the initials of each of  those present        You have then solved this problem  without resorting to arithmetic and without explicit counting         There are numbers at work for us here all the same and  they allow precise comparison of one collection with another   even though the members that make up the collections could  have entirely different characters  as is the case here  where  one set is a collection of people  while the other consists of  pieces of paper        What numbers allow us to do is to  compare the relative size of one set with another    arithmetic         Rather  it evolved naturally as certain devices were found  in practice to be both workable and useful   Film has no grammar        There are  however  some  vaguely defined rules of usage in cinematic language  and the  syntax of film   its systematic arrangement   orders these  rules and indicates relationships among them        As with  written and spoken languages  it is important to remember  that the syntax of film is a result of its usage  not a  determinant of it        There is nothing preordained about  film syntax        Like the syntax of written and spoken  language  the syntax of film is an organic development   descriptive rather than prescriptive  and it has changed  considerably over the years         Hollywood Grammar   may sound laughable now  but during the thirties  forties  and  early fifties it was an accurate model of the way Hollywood  films were constructed         preordained                                            A     B                     Research from the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation  in the USA shows that people feel that  materialism   somehow comes between them and the satisfaction of their  social needs  A report entitled Yearning for Balance  based  on a nationwide survey of Americans  concluded that they  were  deeply ambivalent about wealth and material gain   A  large majority of people wanted society to  move away  from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on  values  community  and family   But they also felt that  these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow  Americans  who  they believed  had become  increasingly  atomized  selfish  and irresponsible   As a result they often  felt isolated  However  the report says  that when brought  together in focus groups to discuss these issues  people  were  surprised and excited to find that others share d  their  views   Rather than uniting us with others in a common  cause  the unease we feel about the loss of social values and  the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is  often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence  which cuts us off from others    ambivalent           Many Americans  believing that materialism keeps them  from  A  social values  feel detached from most  others  but this is actually a fairly  B  concern   A   B   A   B    pursuing    unnecessary   pursuing    common   holding

well crafted text with no expert knowledge  and come away with a good approximation of what has been  intended by the author  The text has become a public document  and the reader can read it with a  a  minimum of effort and  struggle  his experience comes close to what Freud has  described as the deployment of  evenly hovering attention    He puts himself in the author s hands  some have had this  experience with great novelists such as Dickens or Tolstoy  and  he  b  follows where the author leads  The real world has  vanished and the fictive world has taken its place  Now consider  the other extreme  When we come to a badly crafted text in  which context and content are not happily joined  we must  struggle to understand  and our sense of what the author  intended probably bears  c  close correspondence to his  original intention  An out of date translation will give us this  experience  as we read  we must bring the language up to date   and understanding comes only at the price of a fairly intense  struggle with the text  Badly presented content with no frame of  reference can provide  d  the same experience  we see the  words but have no sense of how they are to be taken  The author  who fails to provide the context has  e  mistakenly assumed  that his picture of the world is shared by all his readers and fails  to realize that supplying the right frame of reference is a critical  part of the task of writing    deployment              evenly hovering attention                                           Building a Wall Between Reality and the Fictive World   Creative

They always gathered at this time of year to assist  with her corn harvest  In return  their grandmother would  reward them with a present and by cooking a delicious feast   The children were all in great spirits  But not Sally  She  disliked working in the corn field as she hated the heat and  the dust   a  She sat silently as the others took a sack each  and then sang their way to the field   B  Sally just wanted to get her present and leave the field  because she was starting to get hot and feel irritated   b  She  had only filled her sack twice  but the others were now taking  their third sacks to the granary  Sally sighed heavily  Then an  idea struck her  To make the sack lighter and speed things up   she quickly filled her last sack with corn stalks  Sally reached  the granary first  and her grandmother asked  c  her to put  aside the final load and write her name on it    granary           stalk      C  They reached the field and started to work happily  Soon  after  Sally joined them with her sack  Around mid morning   their grandmother came with ice cold lemonade and peach  pie  After finishing  the children continued working until the  sun was high and their sacks were bursting  Each child had to  make three trips to the granary  Grandmother was impressed  by their efforts and  d  she wanted to give them presents  accordingly   D  Grandmother asked the other

froze   He was not sure if he could play as well as before the injury  A  serious wrist injury had caused him to miss the rest of the  season  Remembering the surgery  he said to himself   I thought  my basketball career was completely over   However  upon  hearing his fans  wild cheers  he felt his body coming alive and  thought   For sure  my fans  friends  and family are looking  forward to watching me play today   As soon as the game  started  he was filled with energy  The first five shots he  attempted went in the basket   I m back  I got this   he shouted    disappointed   unhappy   excited   indifferent   anxious   confident   impatient   calm   eager   ashamed                                   We live in a time when everyone seems to be looking for  quick and sure solutions  Computer companies have even  begun to advertise ways in which computers can replace  parents  They are too late  television has already done that    Seriously  however  in every branch of education  including  moral education  we make a mistake when we suppose that a  particular batch of content or a particular teaching method or a  particular configuration of students and space will accomplish  our ends  The answer is both harder and simpler  We  parents  and teachers  have to live with our children  talk to them   listen to them  enjoy their company  and show them by what  we do and how we talk that it is possible to live appreciatively  or  at least  nonviolently with most other people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Flicking the collaboration light switch                                  Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that  leaders are uniquely positioned to do  because several  obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working  alone  For one thing  the fear of being left out of the loop can  keep them glued to their enterprise social media  Individuals  don t want to be  or appear to be  isolated  For another   knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of  comfort and security  because people can adjust their own  behavior to be in harmony with the group  It s risky to go off  on their own to try something new that will probably not be  successful right from the start  But even though it feels  reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected  it s better for  the organization if they periodically go off and think for  themselves and generate diverse  if not quite mature  ideas   Thus  it becomes the leader s job to create conditions that are  good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even  when people wouldn t choose it for themselves  without  making it seem like a punishment    intermittent         breaking physical barriers and group norms that prohibit cooperation   having people stop working together and start working individually   encouraging people to devote more time to online collaboration   shaping environments where higher productivity is required   requiring workers to focus their attention on group projects                          Historically  the professions and society have engaged in a  negotiating process intended to define the terms of their  relationship  At the heart of this process is the tension between  the professions  pursuit of autonomy and the public s demand  for accountability  Society s granting of power and privilege to  the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to  contribute to social well being and to conduct their affairs in a  manner consistent with broader social values  It has long been  recognized that the expertise and privileged position of  professionals confer authority and power that could readily be  used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they  serve  As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago   Men are  qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition  to put moral chains upon their own appetites   Autonomy has  never been a one way street and is never granted absolutely and  irreversibly     autonomy         privilege         premise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In Kant s view  geometrical shapes are too perfect to induce  an aesthetic experience  Insofar as they agree with the  underlying concept or idea  thus possessing the precision  that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated  geometrical  shapes can be grasped  but they do not give rise to emotion   and  most importantly  they do not move the imagination to  free and new  mental  lengths  Forms or phenomena  on the  contrary  that possess a degree of immeasurability  or that do  not appear constrained  stimulate the human imagination   hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience   The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable  objects  indefinable or formless objects  can be defined as  enjoying one s own emotional and mental activity  Namely   the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to  understand and decode the phenomenon present to view   Furthermore  part of the pleasure comes from having one s  comfort zone  momentarily  violated    geometrical

system of public administration and management to  keep order  With this administrative management system  urban  institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing  levels of services to their citizenry  provided through a taxation  process and or fee for services  e g   police and fire  street  maintenance  utilities  waste management  etc    Frequently this  has displaced citizen involvement  Money for services is not a  replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation   Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by  government being the substitute provider  Consequentially  there  is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of  responsibility of our urban based society to become involved   The sense of community and associated responsibility of all  citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing   Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can  have serious implications  This impedes the nations of the world  to be responsive to natural and man made disasters as part of  global preparedness    supplant          impede         A Sound Citizen Responsibility in a Sound Government   Always

child of a  coal miner  Henry Moore showed a talent for art from early on  in school  After World War I  during which he volunteered for  army service  Moore began to study sculpture at the Leeds  School of Art  Then  he entered the Royal College of Art in  London and earned his degree there  His sculptures  known  around the world  present the forms of the body in a unique  way  One of his artistic themes was mother and child as  shown in Madonna and Child at St  Matthew s Church in  Northampton  He achieved financial success from his hard  work and established the Henry Moore

      Accepting whatever others are communicating only pays off  if their interests correspond to ours  think cells in a body   bees in a beehive  As far as communication between humans  is concerned  such commonality of interests   is rarely  achieved  even a pregnant mother has reasons to mistrust the  chemical signals sent by her fetus  Fortunately  there are ways  of making communication work even in the most adversarial  of relationships  A prey can convince a predator not to chase    it  But for such communication to occur  there must be  strong guarantees   which those who receive the signal will  be better off believing it  The messages have to be kept  on the  whole    honest  In the case of humans  honesty is maintained  by a set of cognitive mechanisms that evaluate   communicated  information  These mechanisms allow us to accept most  beneficial messages  to be open  while rejecting most  harmful messages  to be vigilant    fetus        adversarial

from another  For instance  a consumer buying a good in  a store will likely trigger the replacement of this product  which  will generate   demands for activities such as manufacturing   resource extraction and  of course  transport  What is different  about transport is that it cannot exist alone and a movement  cannot be   stored  An unsold product can remain on the shelf  of a store until bought  often with discount incentives   but an  unsold seat on a flight or unused cargo capacity in the same  flight remains unsold and cannot be brought back as additional  capacity   later  In this case an opportunity has been   seized   since the amount of transport being offered has exceeded the  demand for it  The derived demand of transportation is often very  difficult to reconcile with an equivalent supply  and actually  transport companies would prefer to have some additional  capacity to accommodate   unforeseen demand  often at much  higher prices     reconcile                                                  When examining the archaeological record of human culture   one has to consider that it is vastly             Many aspects  of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low  archaeological visibility  meaning they are difficult to identify  archaeologically  Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible  or  material  aspects of culture  things that can be handled and  photographed  such as tools  food  and structures  Reconstructing  intangible aspects of culture is more difficult  requiring that  one draw more inferences from the tangible  It is relatively  easy  for example  for archaeologists to identify and draw  inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and  food remains  Using the same kinds of physical remains to  draw inferences about social systems and what people were  thinking about is more difficult  Archaeologists do it  but there  are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from  physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations  about belief systems    archaeological         outdated   factual   incomplete   organized   detailed     Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way  for some people to  To test this idea  Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave    participants false feedback about their test performance  and  then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as  the next part of the study  When the video came on  showing  nature scenes with a musical soundtrack  the experimenter  exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly  to get the correct one  leaving the participant alone as the  video played  The participants who had received failure  feedback watched the video much longer than those who  thought they had succeeded  The researchers concluded that  distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve  the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches  between the self and self guides  In contrast  successful  participants had little wish to be distracted from their  self related thoughts    mundane        ignore uncomfortable comments from their close peers   escape painful self awareness through distraction   receive constructive feedback from the media   refocus their divided attention to a given task    engage themselves in intense self reflection                                           It is important to recognise the interdependence between  individual  culturally formed actions and the state of cultural  integration  People work within the forms provided by the  cultural patterns that they have internalised  however  contradictory these may be  Ideas are worked out as logical  implications or consequences of other accepted ideas  and it is in  this way that cultural innovations and discoveries are possible   New ideas are discovered through logical reasoning  but such  discoveries are inherent in and integral to the conceptual system  and are made possible only because of the acceptance of its  premises  For example  the discoveries of new prime numbers  are  real  consequences of the particular number system employed   Thus  cultural ideas show  advances  and  developments   because they    The  cumulative work of many individuals produces a corpus of  knowledge within which certain  discoveries  become possible  or more likely  Such discoveries are  ripe  and could not have  occurred earlier and are also likely to be made simultaneously  by numbers of individuals         corpus            simultaneously        are outgrowths of previous ideas   stem from abstract reasoning ability   form the basis of cultural universalism   emerge between people of the same age   promote individuals  innovative thinking     Enabling animals to  is an almost universal function of learning  Most animals   innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered   Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous  treating them with  caution has survival value  If persisted in  however  such  careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other  necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution  would be lost  A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every  puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never  win races  not even with a lazy rabbit  To overcome this  problem  almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur  frequently  Confronted by a strange object  an inexperienced  animal may freeze or attempt to hide  but if nothing unpleasant  happens  sooner or later it will continue its activity  The  possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful   so if it poses no immediate threat  a closer inspection may be  worthwhile         innately          weigh the benefits

maximization  represents one framework    From this  perspective  it is assumed that individuals are rational actors   i e   that they make migration decisions based on their  assessment of the costs as well as benefits of remaining in a  given area versus the costs and benefits of leaving    Benefits  may include but are not limited to short term and long term  monetary gains  safety  and greater freedom of cultural  expression    People with greater financial benefits tend to  use their money to show off their social status by purchasing  luxurious items    Individual costs include but are not limited  to the expense of travel  uncertainty of living in a foreign land   difficulty of adapting to a different language  uncertainty about  a different culture  and the great concern about living in a new  land    Psychic costs associated with separation from family   friends  and the fear of the unknown also should be taken into  account in cost benefit assessments    psychic

profitable   high volume products that serve populous customer  segments than into risky  less profitable  low volume  products that may serve current noncustomers  Given that  choice  these companies may choose to leave the green  segment of the market to small niche competitors   B  Even if the green product succeeds  it may cannibalize the  company s higher profit mainstream offerings  Given such  downsides  companies serving mainstream consumers with  successful mainstream products face what seems like an  obvious investment decision   C  Furthermore  the restrictive ingredient lists and design  criteria that are typical of such products may make  green products inferior to mainstream products on core  performance dimensions  e g   less effective cleansers   In  turn  the higher costs

commercial ventures have been  launched that offer social robots as personal home  assistants  perhaps eventually to rival existing smart home  assistants   A  They might be motorized and can track the user around  the room  giving the impression of being aware of the  people in the environment  Although personal robotic  assistants provide services similar to those of smart home  assistants  their social presence offers an opportunity that  is unique to social robots   B  Personal robotic assistants are devices that have no  physical manipulation or locomotion capabilities  Instead   they have a distinct social presence and have visual  features suggestive of their ability to interact socially  such  as eyes  ears  or a mouth   C  For instance  in addition to playing music  a social personal  assistant robot would express its engagement with the  music so that users would feel like they are listening to the  music together with the robot  These robots can be used as  surveillance

the relationships between the structural  elements of materials and their properties   The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number  of materials  those that occur naturally  stone  wood  clay   skins  and so on        With time  they discovered techniques  for producing materials that had properties superior to those of  the natural ones  these new materials included pottery and  various metals        Furthermore  it was discovered that the  properties of a material could be altered by heat treatments and  by the addition of other substances        At this point  materials  utilization was totally a selection process that involved deciding  from a given  rather limited set of materials  the one best suited  for an application based on its characteristics        This  knowledge  acquired over approximately the past     years  has  empowered them to fashion  to a large degree  the characteristics  of materials        Thus  tens of thousands of different materials  have evolved with rather specialized characteristics that meet  the needs of our modern and complex society  including metals   plastics  glasses  and fibers       Personal stories connect with larger narratives to generate  new identities  The growing complexity of the social dynamics determining  food choices makes the job of marketers and advertisers  increasingly more difficult        In the past  mass production  allowed for accessibility and affordability of products  as well  as their wide distribution  and was accepted as a sign of  progress        Nowadays it is increasingly replaced by  the fragmentation of consumers among smaller and smaller  segments that are supposed to reflect personal preferences        Everybody feels different and special and expects  products serving his or her inclinations        In reality  these  supposedly individual preferences end up overlapping with  emerging   temporary   always  changing   almost  tribal  formations solidifying around cultural sensibilities  social  identifications  political sensibilities  and dietary and health  concerns        These consumer communities go beyond  national boundaries  feeding on global and widely shared  repositories of ideas  images  and practices         fragmentation         repository                                         A     B                     The computer has  to a considerable extent  solved the  problem of acquiring  preserving  and retrieving information   Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in  manageable form  The computer makes available a range of  data unattainable in the age of books  It packages it  effectively  style is no longer needed to make it accessible   nor is memorization  In dealing with a single decision  separated from its context  the computer supplies tools  unimaginable even a decade ago  But it also diminishes  perspective  Because information is so accessible and  communication instantaneous  there is a diminution of focus  on its significance  or even on the definition of what is  significant  This dynamic may encourage policymakers to  wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it  and to  regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events  rather than part of a historical continuum  When this  happens  manipulation of information replaces reflection as  the principal policy tool    retrieve                diminution       Although the computer is clearly   A   at handling  information in a decontextualized way  it interferes with our  making   B   judgments

the experimental group  receives a vitamin C  supplement  and the other  the control group  does not   Researchers observe both groups to determine whether one  group has fewer or shorter colds than the other  The following  discussion describes some of the pitfalls inherent in an  experiment of this kind and ways to  a  avoid them  In sorting  subjects into two groups  researchers must ensure that each  person has an  b  equal chance of being assigned to either the  experimental group or the control group  This is accomplished  by randomization  that is  the subjects are chosen randomly  from the same population by flipping a coin or some other  method involving chance  Randomization helps to ensure that  results reflect the treatment and not factors that might  influence the grouping of subjects  Importantly  the two  groups of people must be similar and must have the same track  record with respect to colds to  c  rule out the possibility that  observed differences in the rate  severity  or duration of colds  might have occurred anyway  If  for example  the control  group would normally catch twice as many colds as the  experimental group  then the findings prove  d  nothing  In  experiments involving a nutrient  the diets of both groups must  also be  e  different  especially with respect to the nutrient  being studied  If those in the experimental group were  receiving less vitamin C from their usual diet  then any effects  of the supplement may not be apparent    pitfall                               Perfect Planning and Faulty Results  A Sad Reality in Research

hear Katie moving around  chopping things on a  wooden cutting board  Wondering what her roommate was  doing   a  she ran to the kitchen  Sally watched Katie  cooking something that looked delicious  But Katie didn t  notice her because she was too focused on preparing for her  cooking test the next day  She was trying to remember what  her professor had said in class that day   B  Katie  surprised by her roommate s words  turned her head  to Sally and sighed   I don t know  This is really hard    Stirring her sauce for pasta  Katie continued   Professor  Brown said that visual aspects make up a key part of a meal   My recipe seems good  but I can t think of any ways to alter  the feeling of the final dish   Visibly frustrated   b  she was  just about to throw away all of her hard work and start again   when Sally suddenly stopped her    C   Wait  You don t have to start over  You just need to add  some color to the plate   Being curious  Katie asked   How  can  c  I do that   Sally took out a container of vegetables  from the refrigerator and replied   How about making colored  pasta to go with  d  your sauce   Smiling  she added   It s not  that hard  and all you need are brightly colored vegetables to  make your pasta green  orange  or even purple   Katie smiled   knowing that now she could make her pasta with beautiful  colors like a photographer   D  In that class  Professor Brown said   You have to present  your food properly  considering every stage of the dining  experience  Imagine you are a photographer   Recalling what  the professor had mentioned  Katie said to herself   We need  to see our ingredients as colors that make up a picture   Sally  could clearly see that Katie was having a hard time preparing  for her cooking test  Trying to make  e  her feel better  Sally  kindly asked   Is there anything I can do to help              A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C     D     B     D     B     C     D

in to her first online counseling  session  she wondered   How can I open my heart to the  counselor through a computer screen   Since the counseling  center was a long drive away  she knew that this would save  her a lot of time  Natalie just wasn t sure if it would be as  helpful as meeting her counselor in person  Once the session  began  however  her concerns went away  She actually started  thinking that it was much more convenient than expected  She  felt as if the counselor were in the room with her  As the  session closed  she told him with a smile   I ll definitely see  you online again     doubtful   satisfied   regretful   confused   confident   ashamed   bored   excited   thrilled   disappointed                                   New ideas  such as those inspired by scientific developments   are often aired and critiqued in our popular culture as part of a  healthy process of public debate  and scientists sometimes  deserve the criticism they get  But the popularization of science  would be greatly enhanced by improving the widespread  images of the scientist  Part of the problem may be that the  majority of the people who are most likely to write novels   plays  and film scripts were educated in the humanities  not in  the sciences  Furthermore  the few scientists turned writers  have used their scientific training as the source material for  thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists   We need more screenplays and novels that present scientists in  a positive light  In our contemporary world  television and film  are particularly influential media  and it is likely that the  introduction of more scientist heroes would help to make  science more attractive

reactive work  second  This means blocking off a large chunk of time every  day for creative work on your own priorities  with the phone  and e mail off  I used to be a frustrated writer  Making this  switch turned me into a productive writer  Yet there wasn t a  single day when I sat down to write an article  blog post  or  book chapter without a string of people waiting for me to get  back to them  It wasn t easy  and it still isn t  particularly when I  get phone messages beginning  I sent you an e mail two hours  ago      By definition  this approach goes against the grain of  others  expectations and the pressures they put on you  It takes  willpower to switch off the world  even for an hour  It feels  uncomfortable  and sometimes people get upset  But it s better  to disappoint a few people over small things  than to abandon  your dreams for an empty inbox  Otherwise  you re sacrificing  your potential for the illusion of professionalism    following an innovative course of action   attempting to satisfy other people s demands   completing challenging work without mistakes   removing social ties to maintain a mental balance   securing enough opportunities for social networking                          Contractors that will construct a project may place more  weight on the planning process  Proper planning forces detailed  thinking about the project  It allows the project manager  or  team  to  build the project in his or her head   The project  manager  or team  can consider different methodologies  thereby deciding what works best or what does not work at all   This detailed thinking may be the only way to discover  restrictions or risks that were not addressed in the estimating  process  It would be far better to discover in the planning phase  that a particular technology or material will not work than in  the execution process  The goal of the planning process for the  contractor is to produce a workable scheme that uses the  resources efficiently within the allowable time and given  budget  A well developed plan does not guarantee that the  executing process will proceed flawlessly or that the project  will even succeed in meeting its objectives  It does  however   greatly improve its chances    execute                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Children can move effortlessly between play and absorption  in a story  as if both are forms of the same activity  The taking of  roles in a narratively structured game of pirates is not very  different than the taking of roles in identifying with characters  as one watches a movie  It might be thought that  as they grow  towards adolescence  people give up childhood play  but this is  not so  Instead  the bases and interests of this activity change  and develop to playing and watching sports  to the fiction of  plays  novels  and movies  and nowadays to video games  In  fiction  one can enter possible worlds  When we experience  emotions in such worlds  this is not a sign that we are being  incoherent or regressed  It derives from trying out metaphorical  transformations of our selves in new ways  in new worlds  in  ways that can be moving and important to us     pirate

approaches  emphasize the losses with age that might impair social  perception  motivational theories indicate that there may be  some gains or qualitative changes  Charles and Carstensen  review a considerable body of evidence indicating that  as  people get older  they tend to prioritize close social relationships   focus more on achieving emotional well being  and attend  more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative  information  These changing motivational goals in old age  have implications for attention to and processing of social cues  from the environment  Of particular importance in considering  emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity  bias  that is  a tendency to notice  attend to  and remember  more positive compared to negative information  The role of  life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults  might show gains in some aspects of social perception    cognitive          impair        Social Perception

distance runners ever  He was also famous  for his distinctive running style  While working in a shoe  factory  he participated in a       meter race and won second  place  After that event  he took a more serious interest in  running and devoted himself to it  At the      Olympic Games  in Helsinki  he won three gold medals in the       meter and         meter races and in the marathon  breaking Olympic  records in each  He was married to Dana Z topkov   who was  an Olympic gold medalist  too  Z topek was also noted for his  friendly personality  In       Z topek invited Ron Clarke  a  great Australian runner who had never won an Olympic gold  medal  to an athletic meeting in Prague  After the meeting  he  gave Clarke one of his gold medals as a gift

the need for a reliable  calendar to regulate agricultural activity as the motivation for  learning about what we now call astronomy  the study of stars  and planets  Early astronomy provided information about when  to plant crops and gave humans   their first formal method of  recording the passage of time  Stonehenge  the       year old  ring of stones in southern Britain    is perhaps the best known  monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in  the world we inhabit  The great markers of Stonehenge point to  the spots on the horizon   where the sun rises at the solstices  and equinoxes   the dates we still use to mark the beginnings  of the seasons  The stones may even have   been used to  predict eclipses  The existence of Stonehenge  built by people  without writing  bears silent testimony both to the regularity of  nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind  immediate appearances and   discovers deeper meanings in  events    monument          eclipse                   testimony                                                   Sport can trigger an emotional response in its consumers of  the kind rarely brought forth by other products  Imagine bank  customers buying memorabilia to show loyalty to their bank  or  consumers   identifying so strongly with their car insurance  company that they get a tattoo with its logo  We know that some  sport followers are so   passionate about players  teams and  the sport itself that their interest borders on obsession  This  addiction provides the emotional glue that binds fans to teams   and maintains loyalty even in the face of on field   failure   While most managers can only dream of having customers that  are as passionate about their products as sport fans  the emotion  triggered by sport can also have a negative impact  Sport s  emotional intensity can mean that organisations have strong  attachments to the past through nostalgia and club tradition  As  a result  they may   increase efficiency  productivity and the  need to respond quickly to changing market conditions  For  example  a proposal to change club colours in order to project a  more attractive image may be   defeated because it breaks a  link with tradition    memorabilia          obsession                                               The growth of academic disciplines and sub disciplines   such as art history or palaeontology  and of particular figures  such as the art critic  helped produce principles and practices  for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping   though it remained a struggle  Moreover  as museums and  universities drew further apart toward the end of the nineteenth  century  and as the idea of objects as a highly valued route to  knowing the world went into decline  collecting began to lose  its status as a worthy intellectual pursuit  especially in the  sciences  The really interesting and important aspects of  science were increasingly those invisible to the naked eye   and the classification of things collected no longer promised  to produce cutting edge knowledge  The term  butterfly  collecting  could come to be used with the adjective  mere  to  indicate a pursuit of academic status    palaeontology           adjective        competitive   novel   secondary   reliable   unconditional     Some of the most insightful work on information seeking  emphasizes  strategic self ignorance   understood as  the use of  ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable  activities that may be harmful to one s future self   The idea here  is that if people are present biased  they might avoid information  that would   perhaps  because it would produce guilt or shame  perhaps because it  would suggest an aggregate trade off that would counsel against  engaging in such activities  St  Augustine famously said   God  give me chastity   tomorrow   Present biased agents think    Please let me know the risks   tomorrow   Whenever people  are thinking about engaging in an activity with short term  benefits but long term costs  they might prefer to delay receipt  of important information  The same point might hold about  information that could make people sad or mad   Please tell me  what I need to know   tomorrow     aggregate          chastity       highlight the value of preferred activities   make current activities less attractive   cut their attachment to past activities   enable them to enjoy more activities   potentially become known to others                                           Concepts of nature are always cultural statements  This  may not strike Europeans as much of an insight  for Europe s  landscape is so much of a blend  But in the new worlds    new  at least to Europeans   the distinction appeared much  clearer not only to European settlers and visitors but also to  their descendants  For that reason  they had the fond conceit  of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations  which could later find expression in an admiration for  wilderness  Ecological relationships certainly have their own  logic and in this sense  nature  can be seen to have a  self regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent  of human intervention  But the context for ecological interactions   We may not  determine how or what a lion eats but we certainly can  regulate where the lion feeds         conceit         primeval              ecological         has supported new environment friendly policies   has increasingly been set by humanity   inspires creative cultural practices   changes too frequently to be regulated   has been affected by various natural conditions     Emma Brindley has investigated the responses of European  robins to the songs of neighbors and strangers  Despite the  large and complex song repertoire of European robins  they  were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and  strangers  When they heard a tape recording of a stranger  they  began to sing sooner  sang more songs  and overlapped their  songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a  neighbor s song  As Brindley suggests  the overlapping of  song may be an aggressive response  However  this difference  in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when  the neighbor s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at  the boundary between that neighbor s territory and the  territory of the bird being tested  If the same neighbor s song  was played at another boundary  one separating the territory of  the test subject from another neighbor  it was treated as the  call of a stranger  Not only does this result demonstrate that    but it also  shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments  is highly important         robin         territory       variety and complexity characterize the robins  songs   song volume affects the robins  aggressive behavior   the robins  poor territorial sense is a key to survival   the robins associate locality with familiar songs   the robins are less responsive to recorded songs                               Kinship ties continue to be important today  In modern  societies such as the United States people frequently have family  get togethers  they telephone their relatives regularly  and they  provide their kin with a wide variety of services    Eugene  Litwak has referred to this pattern of behaviour as the  modified  extended family     It is an extended family structure because  multigenerational ties are maintained  but it is modified  because it does not usually rest on co residence between the  generations and most extended families do not act as corporate  groups    Although modified extended family members often  live close by  the modified extended family does not require  geographical proximity and ties are maintained even when  kin are separated by considerable distances    The oldest  member of the family makes the decisions on important  issues  no matter how far away family members live from each  other    In contrast to the traditional extended family where  kin always live in close proximity  the members of modified  extended families may freely move away from kin to seek  opportunities for occupational advancement     kin         proximity                                                       Spatial reference points are larger than themselves  This  isn t really a paradox  landmarks are themselves  but they  also define neighborhoods around themselves    A  In a paradigm that has been repeated on many campuses   researchers first collect a list of campus landmarks from  students  Then they ask another group of students to  estimate the distances between pairs of locations  some to  landmarks  some to ordinary buildings on campus   B  This asymmetry of distance estimates violates the most  elementary principles of Euclidean distance  that the  distance from A to B must be the same as the distance  from B to A  Judgments of distance  then  are not  necessarily coherent   C  The remarkable finding is that distances from an ordinary  location to a landmark are judged shorter than distances  from a landmark to an ordinary location  So  people would  judge the distance from Pierre s house to the Eiffel Tower  to be shorter than the distance from the Eiffel Tower to  Pierre s house  Like black holes  landmarks seem to pull  ordinary locations toward themselves  but ordinary places  do not    asymmetry          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                            A firm is deciding whether to invest in shipbuilding  If it  can produce at sufficiently large scale  it knows the venture  will be profitable    A  There is a  good  outcome  in which both types of  investments are made  and both the shipyard and the  steelmakers end up profitable and happy  Equilibrium is  reached  Then there is a  bad  outcome  in which neither  type of investment is made  This second outcome also is  an equilibrium because the decisions not to invest  reinforce each other    B  Assume that shipyards are the only potential customers of  steel  Steel producers figure they ll make money if there s  a shipyard to buy their steel  but not otherwise  Now we  have two possible outcomes   what economists call   multiple equilibria     C  But one key input is low cost steel  and it must be produced  nearby  The company s decision boils down to this  if there  is a steel factory close by  invest in shipbuilding  otherwise   don t invest  Now consider the thinking of potential steel  investors in the region         equilibrium        A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A

observe their subordinates  performance  In most organizations  the employee s immediate supervisor  evaluates the employee s performance        This is because  the supervisor is responsible for the employee s performance   providing supervision  handing out assignments  and developing  the employee        Should supervisors rate employees on  performance dimensions they cannot observe        To  eliminate this dilemma  more and more organizations are  implementing assessments referred to as     degree evaluations        Employees are rated not only by their supervisors but  by coworkers  clients or citizens  professionals in other  agencies with whom they work  and subordinates        The  reason for this approach is that often coworkers and clients or  citizens have a greater opportunity to observe an employee s  performance and are in a better position to evaluate many  performance dimensions     subordinate            This is particularly true since one aspect of sleep is decreased  responsiveness to the environment  The role that sleep plays in evolution is still under study        One possibility is that it is an advantageous adaptive  state of decreased metabolism for an animal when there are no  more pressing activities        This seems true for deeper  states of inactivity such as hibernation during the winter when  there are few food supplies  and a high metabolic cost to  maintaining adequate temperature        It may be true in  daily situations as well  for instance for a prey species to avoid  predators after dark        On the other hand  the apparent  universality of sleep  and the observation that mammals such  as cetaceans have developed such highly complex mechanisms  to preserve sleep on at least one side of the brain at a time   suggests that sleep additionally provides some vital service s   for the organism        If sleep is universal even when this  potential price must be paid  the implication may be that it has  important functions that cannot be obtained just by quiet   wakeful resting         metabolism           mammal                                          A     B                     The idea that planting trees could have a social or  political significance appears to have been invented by  the English  though it has since spread widely  According  to Keith Thomas s history Man and the Natural World   seventeenth  and eighteenth century aristocrats began  planting hardwood trees  usually in lines  to declare the  extent of their property and the permanence of their claim  to it   What can be more pleasant   the editor of a  magazine for gentlemen asked his readers   than to have  the bounds and limits of your own property preserved and  continued from age to age by the testimony of such living  and growing witnesses   Planting trees had the additional  advantage of being regarded as a patriotic act  for the  Crown had declared a severe shortage of the hardwood on  which the Royal Navy depended    aristocrat         patriotic         For English aristocrats  planting trees served as statements  to mark the   A   ownership of their land  and it  was also considered to be a

The scope of the right to  privacy is  a  similarly restricted by the general interest in  preventing crime or in promoting public health  However   when we move away from the property based notion of a  right  where the right to privacy would protect  for example   images and personality   to modern notions of private and  family life  we find it  b  easier to establish the limits of the  right  This is  of course  the strength of the notion of privacy   in that it can adapt to meet changing expectations and  technological advances   In sum  what is privacy today  The concept includes a  claim that we should be unobserved  and that certain  information and images about us should not be  c  circulated  without our permission  Why did these privacy claims arise   They arose because powerful people took offence at such  observation  Furthermore  privacy incorporated the need to  protect the family  home  and correspondence from  arbitrary  d  interference and  in addition  there has been a  determination to protect honour and reputation  How is  privacy protected  Historically  privacy was protected by  restricting circulation of the damaging material  But if the  concept of privacy first became interesting legally as a  response to reproductions of images through photography and  newspapers  more recent technological advances  such as data  storage  digital images  and the Internet   e  pose new threats  to privacy  The right to privacy is now being reinterpreted to  meet those challenges    arbitrary                                Side Effects of Privacy Protection

 challenge  Sophia tried to keep herself planted firmly in the  boat  paying attention to the waves crashing against the rocks   As the water got rougher  she was forced to paddle harder to  keep the waves from tossing her into the water  Her friends Mia  and Rebecca were paddling eagerly behind her to balance the  boat  They were soaked from all of the spray  Mia shouted to  Sophia   Are you OK  Aren t  a  you scared     paddle         B   You ve got a good point  It s a real advantage to graduate  from college with the mindset of a daring adventurer   Mia  said  Rebecca quickly added   That s why I went to  Mongolia before I started my first job out of college   Teaching English there for two months was a big challenge  for me  But  b  I learned a lot from the experience  It really  gave me the courage to try anything in life   Listening to her  friends  Sophia looked at  c  her own reflection in the water  and saw a confident young woman smiling back at her   C   I m great   Sophia shouted back excitedly  Even though  the boat was getting thrown around  the girls managed to  avoid hitting any rocks  Suddenly  almost as quickly as the  water had got rougher  the river seemed to calm down  and  they all felt relaxed  With a sigh of relief  Sophia looked  around   Wow  What a wonderful view    d  she shouted   The scenery around them was breathtaking  Everyone was  speechless  As they enjoyed the emerald green Rocky  Mountains  Mia said   No wonder rafting is the best thing to  do in Colorado    D  Agreeing with her friend  Rebecca gave a thumbs up    Sophia  your choice was excellent   she said with a delighted  smile   I thought you were afraid of water  though  Sophia    Mia said  Sophia explained   Well  I was before I started  rafting  But I graduate from college in a few months  And   before I do  I wanted to do something really adventurous to  test my bravery  I thought that if I did something completely  crazy  it might give  e  me more confidence when I m  interviewing for jobs   Now they could see why she had  suggested going rafting             A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C     D     B     D     B

 we want to invite you for the opening of the concert   Your reputation as a pianist is well known  and everyone will  be very happy to see your performance  Beautiful piano  melodies will help create

froze   He was not sure if he could play as well as before the injury  A  serious wrist injury had caused him to miss the rest of the  season  Remembering the surgery  he said to himself   I thought  my basketball career was completely over   However  upon  hearing his fans  wild cheers  he felt his body coming alive and  thought   For sure  my fans  friends  and family are looking  forward to watching me play today   As soon as the game  started  he was filled with energy  The first five shots he  attempted went in the basket   I m back  I got this   he shouted    disappointed   unhappy   excited   indifferent   anxious   confident   impatient   calm   eager   ashamed                                   We live in a time when everyone seems to be looking for  quick and sure solutions  Computer companies have even  begun to advertise ways in which computers can replace  parents  They are too late  television has already done that    Seriously  however  in every branch of education  including  moral education  we make a mistake when we suppose that a  particular batch of content or a particular teaching method or a  particular configuration of students and space will accomplish  our ends  The answer is both harder and simpler  We  parents  and teachers  have to live with our children  talk to them   listen to them  enjoy their company  and show them by what  we do and how we talk that it is possible to live appreciatively  or  at least  nonviolently with most other people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Flicking the collaboration light switch                                  Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that  leaders are uniquely positioned to do  because several  obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working  alone  For one thing  the fear of being left out of the loop can  keep them glued to their enterprise social media  Individuals  don t want to be  or appear to be  isolated  For another   knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of  comfort and security  because people can adjust their own  behavior to be in harmony with the group  It s risky to go off  on their own to try something new that will probably not be  successful right from the start  But even though it feels  reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected  it s better for  the organization if they periodically go off and think for  themselves and generate diverse  if not quite mature  ideas   Thus  it becomes the leader s job to create conditions that are  good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even  when people wouldn t choose it for themselves  without  making it seem like a punishment    intermittent         breaking physical barriers and group norms that prohibit cooperation   having people stop working together and start working individually   encouraging people to devote more time to online collaboration   shaping environments where higher productivity is required   requiring workers to focus their attention on group projects                          Historically  the professions and society have engaged in a  negotiating process intended to define the terms of their  relationship  At the heart of this process is the tension between  the professions  pursuit of autonomy and the public s demand  for accountability  Society s granting of power and privilege to  the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to  contribute to social well being and to conduct their affairs in a  manner consistent with broader social values  It has long been  recognized that the expertise and privileged position of  professionals confer authority and power that could readily be  used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they  serve  As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago   Men are  qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition  to put moral chains upon their own appetites   Autonomy has  never been a one way street and is never granted absolutely and  irreversibly     autonomy         privilege         premise                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In Kant s view  geometrical shapes are too perfect to induce  an aesthetic experience  Insofar as they agree with the  underlying concept or idea  thus possessing the precision  that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated  geometrical  shapes can be grasped  but they do not give rise to emotion   and  most importantly  they do not move the imagination to  free and new  mental  lengths  Forms or phenomena  on the  contrary  that possess a degree of immeasurability  or that do  not appear constrained  stimulate the human imagination   hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience   The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable  objects  indefinable or formless objects  can be defined as  enjoying one s own emotional and mental activity  Namely   the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to  understand and decode the phenomenon present to view   Furthermore  part of the pleasure comes from having one s  comfort zone  momentarily  violated    geometrical

natural inclination towards aesthetic precision   aesthetic pleasure from things unconstrained                            The world has become a nation of laws and governance that has  introduced a system of public administration and management to  keep order  With this administrative management system  urban  institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing  levels of services to their citizenry  provided through a taxation  process and or fee for services  e g   police and fire  street  maintenance  utilities  waste management  etc    Frequently this  has displaced citizen involvement  Money for services is not a  replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation   Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by  government being the substitute provider  Consequentially  there  is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of  responsibility of our urban based society to become involved   The sense of community and associated responsibility of all  citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing   Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can  have serious implications  This impedes the nations of the world  to be responsive to natural and man made disasters as part of  global preparedness    supplant          impede         A Sound Citizen Responsibility in a Sound Government   Always

child of a  coal miner  Henry Moore showed a talent for art from early on  in school  After World War I  during which he volunteered for  army service  Moore began to study sculpture at the Leeds  School of Art  Then  he entered the Royal College of Art in  London and earned his degree there  His sculptures  known  around the world  present the forms of the body in a unique  way  One of his artistic themes was mother and child as  shown in Madonna and Child at St  Matthew s Church in  Northampton  He achieved financial success from his hard  work and established the Henry Moore

      Accepting whatever others are communicating only pays off  if their interests correspond to ours  think cells in a body   bees in a beehive  As far as communication between humans  is concerned  such commonality of interests   is rarely  achieved  even a pregnant mother has reasons to mistrust the  chemical signals sent by her fetus  Fortunately  there are ways  of making communication work even in the most adversarial  of relationships  A prey can convince a predator not to chase    it  But for such communication to occur  there must be  strong guarantees   which those who receive the signal will  be better off believing it  The messages have to be kept  on the  whole    honest  In the case of humans  honesty is maintained  by a set of cognitive mechanisms that evaluate   communicated  information  These mechanisms allow us to accept most  beneficial messages  to be open  while rejecting most  harmful messages  to be vigilant    fetus        adversarial

from another  For instance  a consumer buying a good in  a store will likely trigger the replacement of this product  which  will generate   demands for activities such as manufacturing   resource extraction and  of course  transport  What is different  about transport is that it cannot exist alone and a movement  cannot be   stored  An unsold product can remain on the shelf  of a store until bought  often with discount incentives   but an  unsold seat on a flight or unused cargo capacity in the same  flight remains unsold and cannot be brought back as additional  capacity   later  In this case an opportunity has been   seized   since the amount of transport being offered has exceeded the  demand for it  The derived demand of transportation is often very  difficult to reconcile with an equivalent supply  and actually  transport companies would prefer to have some additional  capacity to accommodate   unforeseen demand  often at much  higher prices     reconcile                                                  When examining the archaeological record of human culture   one has to consider that it is vastly             Many aspects  of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low  archaeological visibility  meaning they are difficult to identify  archaeologically  Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible  or  material  aspects of culture  things that can be handled and  photographed  such as tools  food  and structures  Reconstructing  intangible aspects of culture is more difficult  requiring that  one draw more inferences from the tangible  It is relatively  easy  for example  for archaeologists to identify and draw  inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and  food remains  Using the same kinds of physical remains to  draw inferences about social systems and what people were  thinking about is more difficult  Archaeologists do it  but there  are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from  physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations  about belief systems    archaeological         outdated   factual   incomplete   organized   detailed     Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way  for some people to  To test this idea  Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave    participants false feedback about their test performance  and  then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as  the next part of the study  When the video came on  showing  nature scenes with a musical soundtrack  the experimenter  exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly  to get the correct one  leaving the participant alone as the  video played  The participants who had received failure  feedback watched the video much longer than those who  thought they had succeeded  The researchers concluded that  distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve  the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches  between the self and self guides  In contrast  successful  participants had little wish to be distracted from their  self related thoughts    mundane        ignore uncomfortable comments from their close peers   escape painful self awareness through distraction   receive constructive feedback from the media   refocus their divided attention to a given task    engage themselves in intense self reflection                                           It is important to recognise the interdependence between  individual  culturally formed actions and the state of cultural  integration  People work within the forms provided by the  cultural patterns that they have internalised  however  contradictory these may be  Ideas are worked out as logical  implications or consequences of other accepted ideas  and it is in  this way that cultural innovations and discoveries are possible   New ideas are discovered through logical reasoning  but such  discoveries are inherent in and integral to the conceptual system  and are made possible only because of the acceptance of its  premises  For example  the discoveries of new prime numbers  are  real  consequences of the particular number system employed   Thus  cultural ideas show  advances  and  developments   because they    The  cumulative work of many individuals produces a corpus of  knowledge within which certain  discoveries  become possible  or more likely  Such discoveries are  ripe  and could not have  occurred earlier and are also likely to be made simultaneously  by numbers of individuals         corpus            simultaneously        are outgrowths of previous ideas   stem from abstract reasoning ability   form the basis of cultural universalism   emerge between people of the same age   promote individuals  innovative thinking     Enabling animals to  is an almost universal function of learning  Most animals   innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered   Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous  treating them with  caution has survival value  If persisted in  however  such  careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other  necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution  would be lost  A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every  puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never  win races  not even with a lazy rabbit  To overcome this  problem  almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur  frequently  Confronted by a strange object  an inexperienced  animal may freeze or attempt to hide  but if nothing unpleasant  happens  sooner or later it will continue its activity  The  possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful   so if it poses no immediate threat  a closer inspection may be  worthwhile         innately          weigh the benefits of treating familiar things with care   plan escape routes after predicting possible attacks   overcome repeated feeding failures for survival   operate in the presence of harmless stimuli   monitor the surrounding area regularly                              A variety of theoretical perspectives provide insight into  immigration  Economics  which assumes that actors engage in  utility maximization  represents one framework    From this  perspective  it is assumed that individuals are rational actors   i e   that they make migration decisions based on their  assessment of the costs as well as benefits of remaining in a  given area versus the costs and benefits of leaving    Benefits  may include but are not limited to short term and long term  monetary gains  safety  and greater freedom of cultural  expression    People with greater financial benefits tend to  use their money to show off their social status by purchasing  luxurious items    Individual costs include but are not limited  to the expense of travel  uncertainty of living in a foreign land   difficulty of adapting to a different language  uncertainty about  a different culture  and the great concern about living in a new  land    Psychic costs associated with separation from family   friends  and the fear of the unknown also should be taken into  account in cost benefit assessments    psychic                                                        Green products involve  in many cases  higher ingredient  costs than those of mainstream products    A  They d rather put money and time into known  profitable   high volume products that serve populous customer  segments than into risky  less profitable  low volume  products that may serve current noncustomers  Given that  choice  these companies may choose to leave the green  segment of the market to small niche competitors   B  Even if the green product succeeds  it may cannibalize the  company s higher profit mainstream offerings  Given such  downsides  companies serving mainstream consumers with  successful mainstream products face what seems like an  obvious investment decision   C  Furthermore  the restrictive ingredient lists and design  criteria that are typical of such products may make  green products inferior to mainstream products on core  performance dimensions  e g   less effective cleansers   In  turn  the higher costs and lower performance of some  products attract only a small portion of the customer base   leading to lower economies of scale in procurement   manufacturing  and distribution    segment

commercial ventures have been  launched that offer social robots as personal home  assistants  perhaps eventually to rival existing smart home  assistants   A  They might be motorized and can track the user around  the room  giving the impression of being aware of the  people in the environment  Although personal robotic  assistants provide services similar to those of smart home  assistants  their social presence offers an opportunity that  is unique to social robots   B  Personal robotic assistants are devices that have no  physical manipulation or locomotion capabilities  Instead   they have a distinct social presence and have visual  features suggestive of their ability to interact socially  such  as eyes  ears  or a mouth   C  For instance  in addition to playing music  a social personal  assistant robot would express its engagement with the  music so that users would feel like they are listening to the  music together with the robot  These robots can be used as  surveillance

the relationships between the structural  elements of materials and their properties   The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number  of materials  those that occur naturally  stone  wood  clay   skins  and so on        With time  they discovered techniques  for producing materials that had properties superior to those of  the natural ones  these new materials included pottery and  various metals        Furthermore  it was discovered that the  properties of a material could be altered by heat treatments and  by the addition of other substances        At this point  materials  utilization was totally a selection process that involved deciding  from a given  rather limited set of materials  the one best suited  for an application based on its characteristics        This  knowledge  acquired over approximately the past     years  has  empowered them to fashion  to a large degree  the characteristics  of materials        Thus  tens of thousands of different materials  have evolved with rather specialized characteristics that meet  the needs of our modern and complex society  including metals   plastics  glasses  and fibers       Personal stories connect with larger narratives to generate  new identities  The growing complexity of the social dynamics determining  food choices makes the job of marketers and advertisers  increasingly more difficult        In the past  mass production  allowed for accessibility and affordability of products  as well  as their wide distribution  and was accepted as a sign of  progress        Nowadays it is increasingly replaced by  the fragmentation of consumers among smaller and smaller  segments that are supposed to reflect personal preferences        Everybody feels different and special and expects  products serving his or her inclinations        In reality  these  supposedly individual preferences end up overlapping with  emerging   temporary   always  changing   almost  tribal  formations solidifying around cultural sensibilities  social  identifications  political sensibilities  and dietary and health  concerns        These consumer communities go beyond  national boundaries  feeding on global and

considerable extent  solved the  problem of acquiring  preserving  and retrieving information   Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in  manageable form  The computer makes available a range of  data unattainable in the age of books  It packages it  effectively  style is no longer needed to make it accessible   nor is memorization  In dealing with a single decision  separated from its context  the computer supplies tools  unimaginable even a decade ago  But it also diminishes  perspective  Because information is so accessible and  communication instantaneous  there is a diminution of focus  on its significance  or even on the definition of what is  significant  This dynamic may encourage policymakers to  wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it  and to  regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events  rather than part of a historical continuum  When this  happens  manipulation of information replaces reflection as  the principal policy tool    retrieve                diminution       Although the computer is clearly   A   at handling  information in a decontextualized way  it interferes with our  making   B   judgments

the experimental group  receives a vitamin C  supplement  and the other  the control group  does not   Researchers observe both groups to determine whether one  group has fewer or shorter colds than the other  The following  discussion describes some of the pitfalls inherent in an  experiment of this kind and ways to  a  avoid them  In sorting  subjects into two groups  researchers must ensure that each  person has an  b  equal chance of being assigned to either the  experimental group or the control group  This is accomplished  by randomization  that is  the subjects are chosen randomly  from the same population by flipping a coin or some other  method involving chance  Randomization helps to ensure that  results reflect the treatment and not factors that might  influence the grouping of subjects  Importantly  the two  groups of people must be similar and must have the same track  record with respect to colds to  c  rule out the possibility that  observed differences in the rate  severity  or duration of colds  might have occurred anyway  If  for example  the control  group would normally catch twice as many colds as the  experimental group  then the findings prove  d  nothing  In  experiments involving a nutrient  the diets of both groups must  also be  e  different  especially with respect to the nutrient  being studied  If those in the experimental group were  receiving less vitamin C from their usual diet  then any effects  of the supplement may not be apparent    pitfall                               Perfect Planning and Faulty Results  A Sad Reality in Research

hear Katie moving around  chopping things on a  wooden cutting board  Wondering what her roommate was  doing   a  she ran to the kitchen  Sally watched Katie  cooking something that looked delicious  But Katie didn t  notice her because she was too focused on preparing for her  cooking test the next day  She was trying to remember what  her professor had said in class that day   B  Katie  surprised by her roommate s words  turned her head  to Sally and sighed   I don t know  This is really hard    Stirring her sauce for pasta  Katie continued   Professor  Brown said that visual aspects make up a key part of a meal   My recipe seems good  but I can t think of any ways to alter  the feeling of the final dish   Visibly frustrated   b  she was  just about to throw away all of her hard work and start again   when Sally suddenly stopped her    C   Wait  You don t have to start over  You just need to add  some color to the plate   Being curious  Katie asked   How  can  c  I do that   Sally took out a container of vegetables  from the refrigerator and replied   How about making colored  pasta to go with  d  your sauce   Smiling  she added   It s not  that hard  and all you need are brightly colored vegetables to  make your pasta green  orange  or even purple   Katie smiled   knowing that now she could make her pasta with beautiful  colors like a photographer   D  In that class  Professor Brown said   You have to present  your food properly  considering every stage of the dining  experience  Imagine you are a photographer   Recalling what  the professor had mentioned  Katie said to herself   We need  to see our ingredients as colors that make up a picture   Sally  could clearly see that Katie was having a hard time preparing  for her cooking test  Trying to make  e  her feel better  Sally  kindly asked   Is there anything I can do to help              A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C     D     B     D     B     C     D

                                                                                                                                                       Natalie                    As Natalie was logging in to her first online counseling  session  she wondered   How can I open my heart to the  counselor through a computer screen   Since the counseling  center was a long drive away  she knew that this would save  her a lot of time  Natalie just wasn t sure if it would be as  helpful as meeting her counselor in person  Once the session  began  however  her concerns went away  She actually started  thinking that it was much more convenient than expected  She  felt as if the counselor were in the room with her  As the  session closed  she told him with a smile   I ll definitely see  you online again     doubtful   satisfied   regretful   confused   confident   ashamed   bored   excited   thrilled   disappointed                                   New ideas  such as those inspired by scientific developments   are often aired and critiqued in our popular culture as part of a  healthy process of public debate  and scientists sometimes  deserve the criticism they get  But the popularization of science  would be greatly enhanced by improving the widespread  images of the scientist  Part of the problem may be that the  majority of the people who are most likely to write novels   plays  and film scripts were educated in the humanities  not in  the sciences  Furthermore  the few scientists turned writers  have used their scientific training as the source material for  thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists   We need more screenplays and novels that present scientists in  a positive light  In our contemporary world  television and film  are particularly influential media  and it is likely that the  introduction of more scientist heroes would help to make  science more attractive

reactive work  second  This means blocking off a large chunk of time every  day for creative work on your own priorities  with the phone  and e mail off  I used to be a frustrated writer  Making this  switch turned me into a productive writer  Yet there wasn t a  single day when I sat down to write an article  blog post  or  book chapter without a string of people waiting for me to get  back to them  It wasn t easy  and it still isn t  particularly when I  get phone messages beginning  I sent you an e mail two hours  ago      By definition  this approach goes against the grain of  others  expectations and the pressures they put on you  It takes  willpower to switch off the world  even for an hour  It feels  uncomfortable  and sometimes people get upset  But it s better  to disappoint a few people over small things  than to abandon  your dreams for an empty inbox  Otherwise  you re sacrificing  your potential for the illusion of professionalism    following an innovative course of action   attempting to satisfy other people s demands   completing challenging work without mistakes   removing social ties to maintain a mental balance   securing enough opportunities for social networking                          Contractors that will construct a project may place more  weight on the planning process  Proper planning forces detailed  thinking about the project  It allows the project manager  or  team  to  build the project in his or her head   The project  manager  or team  can consider different methodologies  thereby deciding what works best or what does not work at all   This detailed thinking may be the only way to discover  restrictions or risks that were not addressed in the estimating  process  It would be far better to discover in the planning phase  that a particular technology or material will not work than in  the execution process  The goal of the planning process for the  contractor is to produce a workable scheme that uses the  resources efficiently within the allowable time and given  budget  A well developed plan does not guarantee that the  executing process will proceed flawlessly or that the project  will even succeed in meeting its objectives  It does  however   greatly improve its chances    execute                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Children can move effortlessly between play and absorption  in a story  as if both are forms of the same activity  The taking of  roles in a narratively structured game of pirates is not very  different than the taking of roles in identifying with characters  as one watches a movie  It might be thought that  as they grow  towards adolescence  people give up childhood play  but this is  not so  Instead  the bases and interests of this activity change  and develop to playing and watching sports  to the fiction of  plays  novels  and movies  and nowadays to video games  In  fiction  one can enter possible worlds  When we experience  emotions in such worlds  this is not a sign that we are being  incoherent or regressed  It derives from trying out metaphorical  transformations of our selves in new ways  in new worlds  in  ways that can be moving and important to us     pirate

approaches  emphasize the losses with age that might impair social  perception  motivational theories indicate that there may be  some gains or qualitative changes  Charles and Carstensen  review a considerable body of evidence indicating that  as  people get older  they tend to prioritize close social relationships   focus more on achieving emotional well being  and attend  more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative  information  These changing motivational goals in old age  have implications for attention to and processing of social cues  from the environment  Of particular importance in considering  emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity  bias  that is  a tendency to notice  attend to  and remember  more positive compared to negative information  The role of  life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults  might show gains in some aspects of social perception    cognitive          impair        Social Perception

distance runners ever  He was also famous  for his distinctive running style  While working in a shoe  factory  he participated in a       meter race and won second  place  After that event  he took a more serious interest in  running and devoted himself to it  At the      Olympic Games  in Helsinki  he won three gold medals in the       meter and         meter races and in the marathon  breaking Olympic  records in each  He was married to Dana Z topkov   who was  an Olympic gold medalist  too  Z topek was also noted for his  friendly personality  In       Z topek invited Ron Clarke  a  great

information about when  to plant crops and gave humans   their first formal method of  recording the passage of time  Stonehenge  the       year old  ring of stones in southern Britain    is perhaps the best known  monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in  the world we inhabit  The great markers of Stonehenge point to  the spots on the horizon   where the sun rises at the solstices  and equinoxes   the dates we still use to mark the beginnings  of the seasons  The stones may even have   been used to  predict eclipses  The existence of Stonehenge  built by people  without writing  bears silent testimony both to the regularity of  nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind  immediate appearances and   discovers deeper meanings in  events    monument          eclipse                   testimony                                                   Sport can trigger an emotional response in its consumers of  the kind rarely brought forth by other products  Imagine bank  customers buying memorabilia to show loyalty to their bank  or  consumers   identifying so strongly with their car insurance  company that they get a tattoo with its logo  We know that some  sport followers are so   passionate about players  teams and  the sport itself that their interest borders on obsession  This  addiction provides the emotional glue that binds fans to teams   and maintains loyalty even in the face of on field   failure   While most managers can only dream of having customers that  are as passionate about their products as sport fans  the emotion  triggered by sport can also have a negative impact  Sport s  emotional intensity can mean that organisations have strong  attachments to the past through nostalgia and club tradition  As  a result  they may   increase efficiency  productivity and the  need to respond quickly to changing market conditions  For  example  a proposal to change club colours in order to project a  more attractive image may be   defeated because it breaks a  link with tradition    memorabilia          obsession                                               The growth of academic disciplines and sub disciplines   such as art history or palaeontology  and of particular figures  such as the art critic  helped produce principles and practices  for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping   though it remained a struggle  Moreover  as museums and  universities drew further apart toward the end of the nineteenth  century  and as the idea of objects as a highly valued route to  knowing the world went into decline  collecting began to lose  its status as a worthy intellectual pursuit  especially in the  sciences  The really interesting and important aspects of  science were increasingly those invisible to the naked eye   and the classification of things collected no longer promised  to produce cutting edge knowledge  The term  butterfly  collecting  could come to be used with the adjective  mere  to  indicate a pursuit of academic status    palaeontology           adjective        competitive   novel   secondary   reliable   unconditional     Some of the most insightful work on information seeking  emphasizes  strategic self ignorance   understood as  the use of  ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable  activities that may be harmful to one s future self   The idea here  is that if people are present biased  they might avoid information  that would   perhaps  because it would produce guilt or shame  perhaps because it  would suggest an aggregate trade off that would counsel against  engaging in such activities  St  Augustine famously said   God  give me chastity   tomorrow   Present biased agents think    Please let me know the risks   tomorrow   Whenever people  are thinking about engaging in an activity with short term  benefits but long term costs  they might prefer to delay receipt  of important information  The same point might hold about  information that could make people sad or mad   Please tell me  what I need to know   tomorrow     aggregate          chastity       highlight the value of preferred activities   make current activities less attractive   cut their attachment to past activities   enable them to enjoy more activities   potentially become known to others                                           Concepts of nature are always cultural statements  This  may not strike Europeans as much of an insight  for Europe s  landscape is so much of a blend  But in the new worlds    new  at least to Europeans   the distinction appeared much  clearer not only to European settlers and visitors but also to  their descendants  For that reason  they had the fond conceit  of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations  which could later find expression in an admiration for  wilderness  Ecological relationships certainly have their own  logic and in this sense  nature  can be seen to have a  self regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent  of human intervention  But the context for ecological interactions   We may not  determine how or what a lion eats but we certainly can  regulate where the lion feeds         conceit         primeval              ecological         has supported new environment friendly policies   has increasingly been set by humanity   inspires creative cultural practices   changes too frequently to be regulated   has been affected by various natural conditions     Emma Brindley has investigated the responses of European  robins to the songs of neighbors and strangers  Despite the  large and complex song repertoire of European robins  they  were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and  strangers  When they heard a tape recording of a stranger  they  began to sing sooner  sang more songs  and overlapped their  songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a  neighbor s song  As Brindley suggests  the overlapping of  song may be an aggressive response  However  this difference  in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when  the neighbor s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at  the boundary between that neighbor s territory and the  territory of the bird being tested  If the same neighbor s song  was played at another boundary  one separating the territory of  the test subject from another neighbor  it was treated as the  call of a stranger  Not only does this result demonstrate that    but it also  shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments  is highly important         robin         territory       variety and complexity characterize the robins  songs   song volume affects the robins  aggressive behavior   the robins  poor territorial sense is a key to survival   the robins associate locality with familiar songs   the robins are less responsive to recorded songs                               Kinship ties continue to be important today  In modern  societies such as the United States people frequently have family  get togethers  they telephone their relatives regularly  and they  provide their kin with a wide variety of services    Eugene  Litwak has referred to this pattern of behaviour as the  modified  extended family     It is an extended family structure because  multigenerational ties are maintained  but it is modified  because it does not usually rest on co residence between the  generations and most extended families do not act as corporate  groups    Although modified extended family members often  live close by  the modified extended family does not require  geographical proximity and ties are maintained even when  kin are separated by considerable distances    The oldest  member of the family makes the decisions on important  issues  no matter how far away family members live from each  other    In contrast to the traditional extended family where  kin always live in close proximity  the members of modified  extended families may freely move away from kin to seek  opportunities for occupational advancement     kin         proximity                                                       Spatial reference points are larger than themselves  This  isn t really a paradox  landmarks are themselves  but they  also define neighborhoods around themselves    A  In a paradigm that has been repeated on many campuses   researchers first collect a list of campus landmarks from  students  Then they ask another group of students to  estimate the distances between pairs of locations  some to  landmarks  some to ordinary buildings on campus   B  This asymmetry of distance estimates violates the most  elementary principles of Euclidean distance  that the  distance from A to B must be the same as the distance  from B to A  Judgments of distance  then  are not  necessarily coherent   C  The remarkable finding is that distances from an ordinary  location to a landmark are judged shorter than distances  from a landmark to an ordinary location  So  people would  judge the distance from Pierre s house to the Eiffel Tower  to be shorter than the distance from the Eiffel Tower to  Pierre s house  Like black holes  landmarks seem to pull  ordinary locations toward themselves  but ordinary places  do not    asymmetry          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                            A firm is deciding whether to invest in shipbuilding  If it  can produce at sufficiently large scale  it knows the venture  will be profitable    A  There is a  good  outcome  in which both types of  investments are made  and both the shipyard and the  steelmakers end up profitable and happy  Equilibrium is  reached  Then there is a  bad  outcome  in which neither  type of investment is made  This second outcome also is  an equilibrium because the decisions not to invest  reinforce each other    B  Assume that shipyards are the only potential customers of  steel  Steel producers figure they ll make money if there s  a shipyard to buy their steel  but not otherwise  Now we  have two possible outcomes   what economists call   multiple equilibria     C  But one key input is low cost steel  and it must be produced  nearby  The company s decision boils down to this  if there  is a steel factory close by  invest in shipbuilding  otherwise   don t invest  Now consider the thinking of potential steel  investors in the region         equilibrium        A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A

observe their subordinates  performance  In most organizations  the employee s immediate supervisor  evaluates the employee s performance        This is because  the supervisor is responsible for the employee s performance   providing supervision  handing out assignments  and developing  the employee        Should supervisors rate employees on  performance dimensions they cannot observe        To  eliminate this dilemma  more and more organizations are  implementing assessments referred to as     degree evaluations        Employees are rated not only by their supervisors but  by coworkers  clients or citizens  professionals in other  agencies with whom they work  and subordinates        The  reason for this approach is that often coworkers and clients or  citizens have a greater opportunity to observe an employee s  performance and are in a better position to evaluate many  performance dimensions     subordinate            This is particularly true since one aspect of sleep is decreased  responsiveness to the environment  The role that sleep plays in evolution is still under study        One possibility is that it is an advantageous adaptive  state of decreased metabolism for an animal when there are no  more pressing activities        This seems true for deeper  states of inactivity such as hibernation during the winter when  there are few food supplies  and a high metabolic cost to  maintaining adequate temperature        It may be true in  daily situations as well  for instance for a prey species to avoid  predators after dark        On the other hand  the apparent  universality of sleep  and the observation that mammals such  as cetaceans have developed such highly complex mechanisms  to preserve sleep on at least one side of the brain at a time   suggests that sleep additionally provides some vital service s   for the organism        If sleep is universal even when this  potential price must be paid  the implication may be that it has  important functions that cannot be obtained just by quiet   wakeful resting         metabolism           mammal                                          A     B                     The idea that planting trees could have a social or  political significance appears to have been invented by  the English  though it has since spread widely  According  to Keith Thomas s history Man and the Natural World   seventeenth  and eighteenth century aristocrats began  planting hardwood trees  usually in lines  to declare the  extent of their property and the permanence of their claim  to it   What can be more pleasant   the editor of a  magazine for gentlemen asked his readers   than to have  the bounds and limits of your own property preserved and  continued from age to age by the testimony of such living  and growing witnesses   Planting trees had the additional  advantage of being regarded as a patriotic act  for the  Crown had declared a severe shortage of the hardwood on  which the Royal Navy depended    aristocrat         patriotic         For English aristocrats  planting trees served as statements  to mark the   A   ownership of their land  and it  was also considered to be a n    B   of their loyalty  to the nation   A   B   A   B    unstable   confirmation   unstable   exaggeration   lasting   exhibition   lasting   manipulation   official   justification                                                                   The right to privacy may extend only to the point where it  does not restrict someone else s right to freedom of  expression or right to information  The scope of the right to  privacy is  a  similarly restricted by the general interest in  preventing crime or in promoting public health  However   when we move away from the property based notion of a  right  where the right to privacy would protect  for example   images and personality   to modern notions of private and  family life  we find it  b  easier to establish the limits of the  right  This is  of course  the strength of the notion of privacy   in that it can adapt to meet changing expectations and  technological advances   In sum  what is privacy today  The concept includes a  claim that we should be unobserved  and that certain  information and images about us should not be  c  circulated  without our permission  Why did these privacy claims arise   They arose because powerful people took offence at such  observation  Furthermore  privacy incorporated the need to  protect the family  home  and correspondence from  arbitrary  d  interference and  in addition  there has been a  determination to protect honour and reputation  How is  privacy protected  Historically  privacy was protected by  restricting circulation of the damaging material  But if the  concept of privacy first became interesting legally as a  response to reproductions of images through photography and  newspapers  more recent technological advances  such as data  storage  digital images  and the Internet   e  pose new threats  to privacy  The right to privacy is now being reinterpreted to  meet those challenges    arbitrary                                Side Effects of Privacy Protection

 challenge  Sophia tried to keep herself planted firmly in the  boat  paying attention to the waves crashing against the rocks   As the water got rougher  she was forced to paddle harder to  keep the waves from tossing her into the water  Her friends Mia  and Rebecca were paddling eagerly behind her to balance the  boat  They were soaked from all of the spray  Mia shouted to  Sophia   Are you OK  Aren t  a  you scared     paddle         B   You ve got a good point  It s a real advantage to graduate  from college with the mindset of a daring adventurer   Mia  said  Rebecca quickly added   That s why I went to  Mongolia before I started my first job out of college   Teaching English there for two months was a big challenge  for me  But  b  I learned a lot from the experience  It really  gave me the courage to try anything in life   Listening to her  friends  Sophia looked at  c  her own reflection in the water  and saw a confident young woman smiling back at her   C   I m great   Sophia shouted back excitedly  Even though  the boat was getting thrown around  the girls managed to  avoid hitting any rocks  Suddenly  almost as quickly as the  water had got rougher  the river seemed to calm down  and  they all felt relaxed  With a sigh of relief  Sophia looked  around   Wow  What a wonderful view    d  she shouted   The scenery around them was breathtaking  Everyone was  speechless  As they enjoyed the emerald green Rocky  Mountains  Mia said   No wonder rafting is the best thing to  do in Colorado    D  Agreeing with her friend  Rebecca gave a thumbs up    Sophia  your choice was excellent   she said with a delighted  smile   I thought you were afraid of water  though  Sophia    Mia said  Sophia explained   Well  I was before I started  rafting  But I graduate from college in a few months  And   before I do  I wanted to do something really adventurous to  test my bravery  I thought that if I did something completely  crazy  it might give  e  me more confidence when I m

concert from her  friend  While surfing the Internet  she came across a review for  the concert  The reviewer was harsh  calling it  an awful  performance   That raised in Sharon s mind the question of  whether it was worthwhile to go  but in the end  she reluctantly  decided to attend the concert  The hall located in the old town was  ancient and run down  Looking around  Sharon again wondered  what kind of show she could expect  But as soon as the tango  started  everything changed  The piano  guitar  flute  and violin  magically flew out in harmony  The audience cheered   Oh my  goodness  What fantastic music   Sharon shouted  The rhythm  and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her  body and soul  The concert was far beyond her expectations    excited   bored   doubtful   amazed   calm   upset   ashamed   grateful   envious   indifferent                                     Occasionally individuals do not merely come out as well as  clearly state what is troubling them and instead select more  indirect means of expressing their annoyance  One companion  might talk to the various other in a way that is condescending  and also indicates underlying hostility  Numerous other times   partners may mope and even frown without genuinely dealing  with an issue  Companions may likewise merely prevent  discussing an issue by swiftly switching over

out as journey edges  For example  retailers often  boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or  installation services  Think of a home goods retailer selling an  unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its  customer s mission incomplete  When that retailer also sells  assembly and delivery  it takes another step in the journey to the  customer s true mission of cooking in his backyard  Another  example is the business to business service contracts that are  layered on top of software sales  Maintenance  installation   training  delivery  anything at all that

rules  competition  and high  performance  many people will be excluded from participation or  avoid other physical activities that are defined as  second class    For example  when a    year old is cut from an exclusive club  soccer team  she may not want to play in the local league because  she sees it as  recreational activity  rather than a real sport  This  can create a situation in which most people are physically  inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform  at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans   a situation  that negatively impacts health and increases health care costs in  a society or community  When sport is defined to include a wide  range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and  integrated into local expressions of social life  physical activity  rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely

 you choose strongly influences your understanding of the  problem  thereby conditioning your approach to solving it  For an  illustration  consider Thibodeau and Broditsky s series of  experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime  in a community  They found that the respondents  suggestions  changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used  to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast  People presented  with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city  emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the  problem  such as eliminating poverty and improving education   On the other hand  people presented with the beast metaphor  focused on remediations  increasing the size of the police force  and prisons     importance of asking the right questions for better solutions    difficulty of using a metaphor to find solutions to a problem   reasons why problem framing prevents solutions from appearing   usefulness of preventive measures in

are the prime mover in  evolution  In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental  threat  In the absence of threat  natural selection tends to resist  change  It is un biological to  explain  behavioural change as  resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of  domain specific brain modules  Evolutionary psychologists  surely know why brains evolved  as Cosmides and Tooby point  out  brains are found only in animals that move  Brains are  behavioural organs  and behavioural adaptation  being immediate  and non random  is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation   So  in animals with brains  behavioural change is the usual first  response to environmental threat  If the change is successful   genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more  gradually

experimental and physiological psychology   After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge  University  he became interested in human behavior  He  believed human behavior to be based on three abilities   intellect  emotion  and will  Being a hardworking scholar  he  held academic positions in several universities in England  He  also wrote many books on psychology including the well known  Introduction to Social Psychology  In       he published The  Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human  behavior  However  The Group Mind was poorly received when  published  Somewhat disappointed  he moved to the United  States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University   Seven years later  he moved to Duke University  where he  developed a psychology department and continued various  research  Today many people read his books  and psychologists  celebrate his intellectual achievements    Cambridge University

serve as the basis of one s self worth  With this form of agency  comes the belief that individual successes   depending primarily  on one s own abilities and actions  and thus  whether by influencing  the environment or trying to accept one s circumstances  the use  of control ultimately centers on the individual  The independent  self may be more   driven to cope by appealing to a sense of  agency or control  However  people from more interdependent  cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual  success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and  harmony  Research has shown   that East Asians prefer to  receive  but not seek  more social support rather than seek personal  control in certain cases  Therefore  people   who hold a more  interdependent self construal may prefer to cope in a way that  promotes harmony in relationships    self construal                                                      Chunking is vital for cognition of music  If we had to encode  it in our brains note by note  we d   struggle to make sense of  anything more complex than the simplest children s songs  Of  course  most accomplished musicians can play compositions  containing many thousands of notes entirely from   memory   without a note out of place  But this seemingly awesome  accomplishment of recall is made   improbable by remembering  the musical process  not the individual notes as such  If you ask  a pianist to start a Mozart sonata from bar forty one  she ll  probably have to   mentally replay the music from the start until  reaching that bar   the score is not simply laid out in her mind   to be read from any random point  It s rather like describing how  you drive to work  you don t simply recite the names of roads as  an abstract list  but have to construct your route by mentally  retracing it  When musicians make a mistake during rehearsal   they wind back to the   start of a musical phrase   let s take it  from the second verse   before restarting    chunking               bar                                                     Research with human runners challenged conventional  wisdom and found that the ground reaction forces at the foot  and the shock transmitted up the leg and through the body  after impact with the ground   as runners  moved from extremely compliant to extremely hard running  surfaces  As a result  researchers gradually began to believe  that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness  prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness  or stiffness of the surface on which they are running  This  view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact  forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff  legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain  As a  result  impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly  similar over a wide range of running surface types  Contrary to  popular belief  running on concrete is not more damaging to  the legs than running on soft sand         compliant            terrain       varied little   decreased a lot   suddenly peaked    gradually appeared   were hardly generated      One of the great risks of writing is that even the simplest of  choices regarding wording or punctuation can sometimes   in ways that may  seem unfair  For example  look again at the old grammar rule  forbidding the splitting of infinitives  After decades of telling  students to never split an infinitive  something just done in  this sentence   most composition experts now acknowledge  that a split infinitive is not a grammar crime  Suppose you  have written a position paper trying to convince your city  council of the need to hire security personnel for the library   and half of the council members   the people you wish to  convince   remember their eighth grade grammar teacher s  warning about splitting infinitives  How will they respond  when you tell them  in your introduction  that librarians are  compelled  to always accompany  visitors to the rare book  room because of the threat of damage  How much of their  attention have you suddenly lost because of their automatic  recollection of what is now a nonrule  It is possible  in other  words  to write correctly and still offend your readers  notions  of your language competence    punctuation          infinitive             reveal your hidden intention   distort the meaning of the sentence   prejudice your audience against you   test your audience s reading comprehension    create fierce debates about your writing topic                                           Even when we do something as apparently simple as picking up  a screwdriver  our brain automatically    We can literally feel things with the end of the screwdriver   When we extend a hand  holding the screwdriver  we  automatically take the length of the latter into account  We can  probe difficult to reach places with its extended end  and  comprehend what we are exploring  Furthermore  we instantly  regard the screwdriver we are holding as  our  screwdriver  and  get possessive about it  We do the same with the much more  complex tools we use  in much more complex situations  The  cars we pilot instantaneously and automatically become  ourselves  Because of this  when someone bangs his fist on  our car s hood after we have irritated him at a crosswalk  we  take it personally  This is not always reasonable  Nonetheless   without the extension of self into machine  it would be  impossible to drive         probe         recalls past experiences of utilizing the tool   recognizes what it can do best without the tool   judges which part of our body can best be used   perceives what limits the tool s functional utility   adjusts what it considers body to include the tool     A large part of what we see is what we expect to see  This  explains why we  see  faces and figures in a flickering  campfire  or in moving clouds  This is why Leonardo da Vinci  advised artists to discover their motifs by staring at patches on  a blank wall  A fire provides a constant flickering change in  visual information that never integrates into anything solid and  thereby allows the brain to engage in a play of hypotheses  On  the other hand  the wall does not present us with very much in  the way of visual clues  and so the brain begins to make more  and more hypotheses and desperately searches for confirmation   A crack in the wall looks a little like the profile of a nose and  suddenly a whole face appears  or a leaping horse  or a  dancing figure  In cases like these the brain s visual strategies  are           flicker         ignoring distracting information unrelated to visual clues    projecting images from within the mind out onto the world   categorizing objects into groups either real or imagined   strengthening connections between objects in the real world   removing the broken or missing parts of an original image                               One of the most widespread  and sadly mistaken  environmental  myths is that living  close to nature  out in the country or in a  leafy suburb is the best  green  lifestyle  Cities  on the other  hand  are often blamed as a major cause of ecological  destruction   artificial  crowded places that suck up precious  resources  Yet  when you look at the facts  nothing could be  farther from the truth    The pattern of life in the country and  most suburbs involves long hours in the automobile each week   burning fuel and pumping out exhaust to get to work  buy  groceries  and take kids to school and activities    City dwellers   on the other hand  have the option of walking or taking transit to  work  shops  and school    The larger yards and houses found  outside cities also create an environmental cost in terms of  energy use  water use  and land use    This illustrates the  tendency that most city dwellers get tired of urban lives and  decide to settle in the countryside    It s clear that the future of  the Earth depends on more people gathering together in compact  communities     compact                                                        Studies of people struggling with major health problems  show that the majority of respondents report they derived  benefits from their adversity  Stressful events sometimes  force people to develop new skills  reevaluate priorities   learn new insights  and acquire new strengths    A  High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health  as  expected  but people who had faced intermediate levels of  adversity were healthier than those who experienced little  adversity  suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can  foster resilience  A follow up study found a similar link  between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects   responses to laboratory stressors   B  Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest  resilience  Thus  having to deal with a moderate amount of  stress may build resilience in the face of future stress    C  In other words  the adaptation process initiated by stress  can lead to personal changes for the better  One study that  measured participants  exposure to thirty seven major  negative events found a curvilinear relationship between  lifetime adversity and mental health     resilience

sweetening and the production of chemicals that  give colour and flavour  The process is induced by the  production of a plant hormone called ethylene    A  If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with  ethylene production or with the processes that respond to  ethylene  fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe  and full of flavour but would still be in good condition  when it arrived at the supermarket shelf    B  In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene  before sale to the consumer to induce ripening  However   fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit  picked ripe from the plant  Biotechnologists therefore saw  an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening  process in fruit   C  The problem for growers and retailers is that ripening is  followed sometimes quite rapidly by deterioration and  decay and the product becomes worthless  Tomatoes and  other fruits are  therefore  usually picked and transported  when they are unripe         deterioration              A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                                         Compounding the difficulty  now more than ever  is what  ergonomists call information overload  where a leader is  overrun with inputs   via e mails  meetings  and phone  calls   that only distract and confuse her thinking     Clarity is often a difficult thing for a leader to obtain   Concerns of the present tend to seem larger than potentially  greater concerns that lie farther away        Some decisions  by their nature present great complexity  whose many  variables must come together a certain way for the leader to  succeed        Alternatively  the leader s information might  be only fragmentary  which might cause her to fill in the gaps  with assumptions   sometimes without recognizing them as  such        And the merits of a leader s most important  decisions  by their nature  typically are not clear cut         Instead those decisions involve a process of assigning weights  to competing interests  and then determining  based upon  some criterion  which one predominates        The result is  one of judgment  of shades of gray  like saying that Beethoven  is a better composer than Brahms         ergonomist             fragmentary             When the team painted fireflies  light organs dark  a new  set of bats took twice as long to learn to avoid them  Fireflies don t just light up their behinds to attract mates   they also glow to tell bats not to eat them  This twist in the tale  of the trait that gives fireflies their name was discovered by  Jesse Barber and his colleagues  The glow s warning role  benefits both fireflies and bats  because these insects taste  disgusting to the mammals        When swallowed  chemicals  released by fireflies cause bats to throw them back up         The team placed eight bats in a dark room with three or four  fireflies plus three times as many tasty insects  including  beetles and moths  for four days        During the first night   all the bats captured at least one firefly        But by the  fourth night  most bats had learned to avoid fireflies and catch  all the other prey instead        It had long been thought that  firefly bioluminescence mainly acted as a mating signal  but  the new finding explains why firefly larvae also glow despite  being immature for mating    bioluminescence                larvae  larva                                              A     B                     Some environments are more likely to lead to fossilization  and subsequent discovery than others  Thus  we cannot  assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or  place means that more individuals were present at that time   or in that place  It may just be that the circumstances at one  period of time  or at one location  were more favourable for  fossilization than they were at other times  or in other places   Likewise  the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a  particular time or place does not have the same implication as  its presence  As the saying goes   absence of evidence is not  evidence of absence   Similar logic suggests that taxa are  likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil  record  and they are likely to have survived beyond the time  of their most recent appearance in the fossil record  Thus  the  first appearance datum  and the last appearance datum of  taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative  statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon    subsequent          hominin fossil            taxa  taxon             Since fossilization and fossil discovery are affected by   A  definitely  conditions  the

land   until recently in the  Andes  for example  land and water rights were  a  combined  so water rights were transferred with the land  However   through state land reforms and the development of additional  sources of supply  water rights have become separated from  land  and may be sold at auction  This therefore  b  favours  those who can pay  rather than ensuring access to all in the  community  The situation arises  therefore  where individuals  may hold land with no water  In Peru  the government grants  water to communities separately from land  and it is up to  the community to allocate it  Likewise in Yemen  the  traditional allocation was one measure  tasah  of water to one  hundred  libnah  of land  This applied only to traditional  irrigation supplies   from runoff  wells  etc   where a supply  was  c  guaranteed  Water derived from the capture of flash  floods is not subject to Islamic law as this constitutes an  uncertain source  and is therefore free for those able to collect  and use it  However  this traditional allocation per unit of land  has been bypassed  partly by the development of new supplies   but also by the  d  decrease in cultivation of a crop of  substantial economic importance  This crop is harvested  throughout the year and thus requires more than its fair share  of water  The economic status of the crop  e  ensures that water  rights can be bought or bribed away from subsistence crops    irrigation             bribe           subsistence crop                                   Water Rights No Longer Tied to Land   Strategies for

that he would win the essay contest  Overly excited  he  shouted   Hooray   At that moment  two tickets to Ace  Amusement Park  the prize  slipped out of the envelope  He  picked them up and read the letter thoroughly while sitting on  the stairs in front of his house   Wait a minute  That s not my  name    a  he said  puzzled  The letter was addressed to his  classmate Stephanie  who had also participated in the contest   B  Once Steven had heard his dad s words  tears started to fill  up in his eyes   I was foolish   Steven said regretfully  He  took the letter and the prize to school and handed them to  Stephanie  He congratulated her wholeheartedly and she was  thrilled  On the way home after school  his steps were light  and full of joy  That night  his dad was very pleased to hear  what he had done at school    b  I am so proud of you   Steven   he said  Then  without a word  he handed Steven  two Ace Amusement Park tickets and winked   C   If I don t tell Stephanie  perhaps she will never know    Steven thought for a moment  He remembered that the winner  would only be notified by mail  As long as he kept quiet   nobody would know  So he decided to sleep on it  The next

for one of your company s swimming pools for our summer  swim camp  However  due to its popularity  thirty more students  are coming to the camp than we expected  so we need one  more swimming pool for them  The rental section on your  website says that there are two other swimming pools during  the summer season  the Splash Pool and the Rainbow Pool   Please let me know if an additional rental would be possible   Thank you in advance  Best Wishes  Nelson Perkins                                                                                                                                      Jessica                    The island tour bus Jessica was riding on was moving slowly  toward the ocean cliffs  Outside  the sky was getting dark   Jessica sighed with concern   I m going to miss the sunset  because of the traffic   The bus arrived at the cliffs  parking lot   While the other passengers were gathering their bags  Jessica  quickly got off the bus and she ran up the cliff that was famous  for its ocean views  She was about to give up when she got to the  top  Just then she saw the setting sun and it still shone brightly in  the sky  Jessica said to herself   The glow of the sun is so beautiful   It s even better than I expected     worried   delighted   bored   confident   relieved   annoyed   joyful   indifferent   regretful   depressed                                   Consider two athletes who both want to play in college  One  says she has to work very hard and the other uses goal setting to  create a plan to stay on track and work on specific skills where  she is lacking  Both are working hard but only the latter is  working smart  It can be frustrating for athletes to work extremely  hard but not make the progress they wanted  What can make the  difference is drive   utilizing the mental gear to maximize  gains made in the technical and physical areas  Drive provides  direction  goals   sustains effort  motivation   and creates a  training mindset that goes beyond simply working hard  Drive  applies direct force on your physical and technical gears   strengthening and polishing them so they can spin with vigor  and purpose  While desire might make you spin those gears  faster and harder as you work out or practice  drive is what built  them in the first place    vigor

                    view from nowhere                                   Our view of the world is not given to us from the outside in  a pure  objective form  it is shaped by our mental abilities  our  shared cultural perspectives and our unique values and beliefs   This is not to say that there is no reality outside our minds or  that the world is just an illusion  It is to say that our version of  reality is precisely that  our version  not the version  There is  no single  universal or authoritative version that makes sense   other than as a theoretical construct  We can see the world only  as it appears to us  not  as it truly is   because there is no  as it  truly is  without a perspective to give it form  Philosopher  Thomas Nagel argued that there is no  view from nowhere    since we cannot see the world except from a particular  perspective  and that perspective influences what we see  We  can experience the world only through the human lenses that  make it intelligible to us

prejudices   unbiased and objective view of the world                          Often overlooked  but just as important a stakeholder  is the  consumer who plays a large role in the notion of the privacy  paradox  Consumer engagement levels in all manner of digital  experiences and communities have simply exploded   and they  show little or no signs of slowing  There is an awareness among  consumers  not only that their personal data helps to drive the  rich experiences that these companies provide  but also that  sharing this data is the price you pay for these experiences  in  whole or in part  Without a better understanding of the what   when  and why of data collection and use  the consumer is often  left feeling vulnerable and conflicted   I love this restaurant finder  app on my phone  but what happens to my data if I press  ok   when asked if that app can use my current location   Armed  with tools that can provide them options  the consumer moves  from passive bystander to active participant    stakeholder           vulnerable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Considerable work by cultural psychologists and anthropologists  has shown that there are indeed large and sometimes surprising  differences in the words and concepts that different cultures have  for describing emotions  as well as in the social circumstances  that draw out the expression of particular emotions  However   those data do not actually show that different cultures have  different emotions  if we think of emotions as central  neurally  implemented states  As for  say  color vision  they just say that   despite the same internal processing architecture  how we  interpret  categorize  and name emotions varies according to  culture and that we learn in a particular culture the social context  in which it is appropriate to express emotions  However  the  emotional states themselves are likely to be quite invariant  across cultures  In a sense  we can think of a basic  culturally  universal emotion set that is shaped by evolution and implemented  in the brain  but the links between such emotional states and  stimuli  behavior  and other cognitive states are plastic and can  be modified by learning in a specific cultural context    anthropologist          stimuli         cognitive         essential links between emotions and behaviors    culturally constructed representation of

        The approach  joint cognitive systems  treats a robot as part of  a human machine team where the intelligence is synergistic   arising from the contributions of each agent  The team consists  of at least one robot and one human and is often called a mixed  team because it is a mixture of human and robot agents   Self driving cars  where a person turns on and off the driving  is  an example of a joint cognitive system  Entertainment robots are  examples of mixed teams as are robots for telecommuting  The  design process concentrates on how the agents will cooperate  and coordinate with each other to accomplish the team goals   Rather than treating robots as peer agents with their own  completely independent agenda  joint cognitive systems  approaches treat robots as helpers such as service animals or sheep  dogs  In joint cognitive system designs  artificial intelligence is  used along with human robot interaction principles to create  robots that can be intelligent enough to be

 His birthplace  Axminster in  Britain  was rich with fossils  and as a child  he naturally became  interested in fossils while collecting them  In       Buckland  won a scholarship and was admitted to Corpus Christi College   Oxford  He developed his scientific knowledge there while  attending John Kidd s lectures on mineralogy and chemistry   After Kidd resigned his position  Buckland was appointed his  successor at the college  Buckland used representative samples  and large scale geological maps in his lectures  which made his  lectures more lively  In       he announced the discovery of the  bones of a giant creature  and he named it Megalosaurus  or   great lizard   He won the prize from the Geological Society  due to his achievements in geology

                                                                Ecosystems differ in composition and extent  They can be  defined as ranging from the communities and interactions of  organisms in your mouth or   those in the canopy of a rain forest  to all those in Earth s oceans  The processes   governing them  differ in complexity and speed  There are systems that turn over  in minutes  and there are others   which rhythmic time  extends to hundreds of years  Some ecosystems are extensive    biomes   such as the African savanna   some cover regions  river  basins   many involve clusters of villages  micro watersheds    others are confined to the level of a single village  the village  pond   In each example there is an element of indivisibility   Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers  and the sum  of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be  lower than the productivity of the whole  other things   being  equal  The mobility of biological populations is a reason  Safe  passages  for example  enable migratory species   to survive    canopy        basin                                                   In recent years urban transport professionals globally have  largely acquiesced to the view that automobile demand in  cities needs to be managed rather than accommodated  Rising  incomes inevitably lead to increases in motorization  Even  without the imperative of climate change  the physical constraints  of densely inhabited cities and the corresponding demands of  accessibility  mobility  safety  air pollution  and urban livability  all   limit the option of expanding road networks purely to  accommodate this rising demand  As a result  as cities develop  and their residents become more prosperous    persuading  people to choose not to use cars becomes an increasingly key  focus of city managers and planners  Improving the quality of   alternative options  such as walking  cycling  and public  transport  is a central element of this strategy  However  the  most direct approach to   accommodating automobile demand  is making motorized travel more expensive or restricting it  with administrative rules  The contribution of motorized travel  to climate change   reinforces this imperative    acquiesce         imperative             constraint                                               Young contemporary artists who employ digital technologies  in their practice rarely make reference to computers  For example   Wade Guyton  an abstractionist who uses a word processing  program and inkjet printers  does not call himself a computer  artist  Moreover  some critics  who admire his work  are little  concerned about his extensive use of computers in the  art making process  This is a marked contrast from three  decades ago when artists who utilized computers were labeled  by critics   often disapprovingly   as computer artists  For the  present generation of artists  the computer  or more appropriately   the laptop  is one in a collection of integrated  portable digital  technologies that link their social and working life  With tablets  and cell phones surpassing personal computers in Internet  usage  and as slim digital devices resemble nothing like the  room sized mainframes and bulky desktop computers of  previous decades  it now appears that the computer artist is  finally      awake   influential   distinct   troublesome    extinct     The critic who wants to write about literature from a formalist  perspective must first be a close and careful reader who examines  all the elements of a text individually and questions how they  come together to create a work of art  Such a reader  who  respects the autonomy of a work  achieves an understanding of it  by    Instead  of examining historical periods  author biographies  or literary  styles  for example  he or she will approach a text with the  assumption that it is a self contained entity and that he or she  is looking for the governing principles that allow the text to  reveal itself  For example  the correspondences between the  characters in James Joyce s short story  Araby  and the people  he knew personally may be interesting  but for the formalist  they are less relevant to understanding how the story creates  meaning than are other kinds of information that the story  contains within itself    entity       putting himself or herself both inside and outside it   finding a middle ground between it and the world   searching for historical realities revealed within it   looking inside it  not outside it or beyond it   exploring its characters  cultural relevance                                           Manufacturers design their innovation processes around  the way they think the process works  The vast majority of  manufacturers still think that product development and service  development are always done by manufacturers  and that  their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to  sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that    Accordingly  manufacturers  have set up market research departments to explore the needs  of users in the target market  product development groups to  think up suitable products to address those needs  and so forth   The needs and prototype solutions of lead users   if  encountered at all   are typically rejected as outliers of no  interest  Indeed  when lead users  innovations do enter a firm s  product line   and they have been shown to be the actual  source of many major innovations for many firms   they  typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic  route         lag       lead users tended to overlook   lead users have already developed   lead users encountered in the market   other firms frequently put into use   both users and firms have valued     Development can get very complicated and fanciful  A  fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process  could go  when a single melodic line  sometimes just a handful  of notes  was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant  work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent  structure  Ludwig van Beethoven s famous Fifth Symphony  provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical  composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping   The opening da da da DUM that everyone has heard somewhere  or another  throughout not only the opening movement  but the remaining   three movements  like a kind of motto or a connective thread   Just as we don t always see the intricate brushwork that goes  into the creation of a painting  we may not always notice how  Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he  develops his material into a large  cohesive statement  But a lot  of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from  the inventiveness behind it  the impressive development of  musical ideas         intricate         coherent           makes the composer s musical ideas contradictory   appears in an incredible variety of ways   provides extensive musical knowledge creatively   remains fairly calm within the structure   becomes deeply associated with one s own enjoyment                              The animal in a conflict between attacking a rival and fleeing  may initially not have sufficient information to enable it to  make a decision straight away    If the rival is likely to win the  fight  then the optimal decision would be to give up immediately  and not risk getting injured    But if the rival is weak and  easily defeatable  then there could be considerable benefit in  going ahead and obtaining the territory  females  food or whatever  is at stake    Animals under normal circumstances maintain a  very constant body weight and they eat and drink enough for  their needs at regular intervals    By taking a little extra time to  collect information about the opponent  the animal is more  likely to reach a decision that maximizes its chances of winning  than if it takes a decision without such information    Many  signals are now seen as having this information gathering or   assessment  function  directly contributing to the mechanism  of the decision making process by supplying vital information  about the likely outcomes of the various options                                                    The fossil record provides evidence of evolution  The  story the fossils tell is one of change  Creatures existed in  the past that are no longer with us  Sequential changes are  found in many fossils showing the change of certain features  over time from a common ancestor  as in the case of the  horse   A  If multicelled organisms were indeed found to have evolved  before single celled organisms  then the theory of evolution  would be rejected  A good scientific theory always allows  for the possibility of rejection  The fact that we have not  found such a case in countless examinations of the fossil  record strengthens the case for evolutionary theory   B  The fossil record supports this prediction  multicelled  organisms are found in layers of earth millions of years  after the first appearance of single celled organisms  Note  that the possibility always remains that the opposite could  be found    C  Apart from demonstrating that evolution did occur  the  fossil record also provides tests of the predictions made  from evolutionary theory  For example  the theory predicts  that single celled organisms evolved before multicelled  organisms     A     C     B

you are invested and have  ownership in something  you overvalue that thing    A  Sometimes  the smartest thing a person can do is quit   Although this is true  it has also become a tired and  played out argument  Sunk cost doesn t always have to be  a bad thing    B  This leads people to continue on paths or pursuits that  should clearly be abandoned  For example  people often  remain in terrible relationships simply because they ve  invested a great deal of themselves into them  Or someone  may continue pouring money into a business that is  clearly a bad idea in the market    C  Actually  you can leverage this human tendency to your  benefit  Like someone invests a great deal of money in a  personal trainer to ensure they follow through on their  commitment  you  too  can invest a great deal up front to  ensure you stay on the path you want to be on         leverage          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                                         Also  it has become difficult for companies to develop new  pesticides  even those that can have major beneficial effects  and few negative effects  Simply maintaining yields at current levels often requires new  cultivars and management methods  since pests and diseases  continue to evolve  and aspects of the chemical  physical  and  social environment can change over several decades        In  the     s  many people considered pesticides to be mainly  beneficial to mankind        Developing new  broadly effective   and persistent pesticides often was considered to be the best way  to control pests on crop plants        Since that time  it has  become apparent that broadly effective pesticides can have  harmful effects on beneficial insects  which can negate their  effects in controlling pests  and that persistent pesticides can  damage non target organisms in the ecosystem  such as birds  and people        Very high costs are involved in following all  of the procedures needed to gain government approval for new  pesticides        Consequently  more consideration is being  given to other ways to manage pests  such as incorporating  greater resistance to pests into cultivars by breeding and using  other biological control methods    pesticide         cultivar         breed           This makes sense from the perspective of information  reliability   The dynamics of collective detection have an interesting  feature  Which cue s  do individuals use as evidence of  predator attack  In some cases  when an individual detects a  predator  its best response is to seek shelter        Departure  from the group may signal danger to nonvigilant animals and  cause what appears to be a coordinated flushing of prey  from the area        Studies on dark eyed juncos  a type of  bird  support the view that nonvigilant animals attend to  departures of individual group mates but that the departure of  multiple individuals causes a greater escape response in the  nonvigilant individuals        If one group member departs   it might have done so for a number of reasons that have little to  do with predation threat        If nonvigilant animals escaped  each time a single member left the group  they would  frequently respond when there was no predator  a false  alarm         On the other hand  when several individuals  depart the group at the same time  a true threat is much more  likely to be present         predator         vigilant           flushing                                          A     B                     Mobilities in transit offer a broad field to be explored by  different disciplines in all faculties  in addition to the  humanities  In spite of increasing acceleration  for example  in travelling through geographical or virtual space  our body  becomes more and more a passive non moving container   which is transported by artefacts or loaded up with inner  feelings of being mobile in the so called information society   Technical mobilities turn human beings into some kind of  terminal creatures  who spend most of their time at rest and  who need to participate in sports in order to balance their  daily disproportion of motion and rest  Have we come  closer to Aristotle s image of God as the immobile mover   when elites exercise their power to move money  things  and people  while they themselves do not need to move at  all  Others  at the bottom of this power  are victims of  mobility structured social exclusion  They cannot decide  how and where to move  but are just moved around or  locked out or even locked in without either the right to  move or the right to stay    In a technology and information society  human beings   whose bodily movement is less   A    appear to  have gained increased mobility and power  and such a  mobility related human condition raises the issue of social   B     A   B   A   B    necessary  inequality   necessary  growth

an emergency  Emergencies are not always clearly  a  labeled  as such   smoke  pouring into a waiting room may be caused  by fire  or it may merely indicate a leak in a steam pipe   Screams in the street may signal an attack or a family quarrel   A man lying in a doorway may be having a coronary   or he  may simply be sleeping off a drunk  A person trying to interpret a situation often looks at those  around him to see how he should react  If everyone else is  calm and indifferent  he will tend to remain so  if everyone  else is reacting strongly  he is likely to become alert  This  tendency is not merely blind conformity  ordinarily we derive  much valuable information about new situations from how  others around us behave  It s a  b  rare traveler who  in  picking a roadside restaurant  chooses to stop at one where  no other cars appear in the parking lot   But occasionally the reactions of others provide  c  accurate  information  The studied nonchalance of patients in a dentist s  waiting room is a poor indication of their inner anxiety  It is  considered embarrassing to  lose your cool  in public  In a  potentially acute situation  then  everyone present will appear  more  d  unconcerned than he is in fact  A crowd can thus  force  e  inaction on its members by implying  through its  passivity  that an event is not an emergency  Any individual  in such a crowd fears that he may appear a fool if he behaves  as though it were    coronary            nonchalance                                    Do We Judge Independently  The Effect of Crowds   Winning Strategy  How Not

other dorm room at the university  and he became  disappointed  His roommate Steve noticed it and asked what  was wrong  Noah answered quietly that he thought their room  was totally boring   a  He wished the space felt a bit more like  their space  Steve agreed and suggested that they could start  personalizing the room like Noah wanted  the next day   B  As they walked through a furniture store  Steve found a  pretty yellow table  Since he knew that yellow was Noah s  favorite color  Steve asked  b  him what he thought about  buying that table  Noah was happy about the yellow table and  said it would make their room more unique  Delighted  Noah  added   Well  yesterday our room was just like any other  place at this school  But after today   c  I really feel like it ll  be our place   Now  they both knew that the place would  provide them with energy and refreshment   C  Noah hardly slept that night making plans for the room   After Steve woke up  they started to rearrange the furniture   All of the chairs and the sofa in their room were facing the TV   Noah mentioned to Steve that most of their visitors usually just  sat and watched TV instead of chatting  In response to  d  his  idea  Steve suggested   How about we put the sofa over there  by the wall so it will be easier to have conversations   Noah  agreed  and they moved it by the wall   D  After changing the place of the sofa  they could see that  they now had a lot of space in the middle of their room   Then  Noah remembered that his brother Sammy had a big  table in his living room for playing board games and told  Steve about it  Steve and Noah both really enjoyed playing  board games  So  Steve replied to Noah    e  I think putting a  table in the middle of our room would be great for drinking  tea as well as playing board games   Both Noah and Steve  agreed and decided to go shopping for a table              A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C     D

Sincerely  Daniel Smith                                                                                                                                            Sharon                    Sharon received a ticket to an upcoming tango concert from her  friend  While surfing the Internet  she came across a review for  the concert  The reviewer was harsh  calling it  an awful  performance   That raised in Sharon s mind the question of  whether it was worthwhile to go  but in the end  she reluctantly  decided to attend the concert  The hall located in the old town was  ancient and run down  Looking around  Sharon again wondered  what kind of show she could expect  But as soon as the tango  started  everything changed  The piano  guitar  flute  and violin  magically flew out in harmony  The audience cheered   Oh my  goodness  What fantastic music   Sharon shouted  The rhythm  and tempo were so energetic and sensational that they shook her  body and soul  The concert was far beyond her expectations    excited   bored   doubtful   amazed   calm   upset   ashamed   grateful   envious   indifferent                                     Occasionally individuals do not merely come out as well as  clearly state what is troubling them and instead select more  indirect means of expressing their annoyance  One companion  might talk to the various other in a way that is condescending  and also indicates underlying hostility  Numerous other times   partners may mope and even frown without genuinely dealing  with an issue  Companions may likewise merely prevent  discussing an issue by swiftly switching over topics when the  subject turns up or by being incredibly vague  Such indirect  ways of expressing temper are not useful since they don t  provide the individual that is the target of the behaviors  an  idea of exactly how to react  They understand their companion  is irritated  but the absence of directness leaves them without  advice regarding what they can do to solve the issue    condescend             mope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             journey edges                                  Many ancillary businesses that today seem almost core at one  time started out as journey edges  For example  retailers often  boost sales with accompanying support such as assembly or  installation services  Think of a home goods retailer selling an  unassembled outdoor grill as a box of parts and leaving its  customer s mission incomplete  When that retailer also sells  assembly and delivery  it takes another step in the journey to the  customer s true mission of cooking in his backyard  Another  example is the business to business service contracts that are  layered on top of software sales  Maintenance  installation   training  delivery  anything at all that turns do it yourself into a  do it for me solution originally resulted from exploring the  edge of where core products intersect with customer journeys    ancillary                intersect         requiring customers to purchase unnecessary goods   decreasing customers  dependence on business services   focusing more on selling end products than components   adding a technological breakthrough to their core products   providing extra services beyond customers  primary purchase                          Official definitions of sport have important implications   When a definition emphasizes rules  competition  and high  performance  many people will be excluded from participation or  avoid other physical activities that are defined as  second class    For example  when a    year old is cut from an exclusive club  soccer team  she may not want to play in the local league because  she sees it as  recreational activity  rather than a real sport  This  can create a situation in which most people are physically  inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform  at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans   a situation  that negatively impacts health and increases health care costs in  a society or community  When sport is defined to include a wide  range of physical activities that are played for pleasure and  integrated into local expressions of social life  physical activity  rates will be high and overall health benefits are likely                                                                                                                                                                                             Problem framing amounts to defining what problem you are  proposing to solve  This is a critical activity because the frame  you choose strongly influences your understanding of the  problem  thereby conditioning your approach to solving it  For an  illustration  consider Thibodeau and Broditsky s series of  experiments in which they asked people for ways to reduce crime  in a community  They found that the respondents  suggestions  changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used  to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast  People presented  with a metaphor comparing crime to a virus invading their city  emphasized prevention and addressing the root causes of the  problem  such as eliminating poverty and improving education   On the other hand  people presented with the beast metaphor  focused on remediations  increasing the size of the police force  and prisons     importance of asking the right questions for better solutions    difficulty of using a metaphor to find solutions to a problem   reasons why problem framing prevents solutions from appearing   usefulness of preventive measures in reducing community crime   effect of problem framing on approaching and solving problems                           A common error in current Darwinian thinking is the  assumption that  selfish genes  are the prime mover in  evolution  In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental  threat  In the absence of threat  natural selection tends to resist  change  It is un biological to  explain  behavioural change as  resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of  domain specific brain modules  Evolutionary psychologists  surely know why brains evolved  as Cosmides and Tooby point  out  brains are found only in animals that move  Brains are  behavioural organs  and behavioural adaptation  being immediate  and non random  is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation   So  in animals with brains  behavioural change is the usual first  response to environmental threat  If the change is successful   genetic adaptation to the

William McDougall  left his mark on experimental and physiological psychology   After receiving a degree in natural sciences in Cambridge  University  he became interested in human behavior  He  believed human behavior to be based on three abilities   intellect  emotion  and will  Being a hardworking scholar  he  held academic positions in several universities in England  He  also wrote many books on psychology including the well known  Introduction to Social Psychology  In       he published The  Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human  behavior  However  The Group Mind was poorly received when  published  Somewhat disappointed  he moved to the United  States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University   Seven years later  he moved to Duke University  where he  developed a psychology department and continued various  research  Today many people read his books  and psychologists  celebrate his intellectual achievements    Cambridge University

self focused agency or control   as these  serve as the basis of one s self worth  With this form of agency  comes the belief that individual successes   depending primarily  on one s own abilities and actions  and thus  whether by influencing  the environment or trying to accept one s circumstances  the use  of control ultimately centers on the individual  The independent  self may be more   driven to cope by appealing to a sense of  agency or control  However  people from more interdependent  cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual  success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and  harmony  Research has shown   that East Asians prefer to  receive  but not seek  more social support rather than seek personal  control in certain cases  Therefore  people   who hold a more  interdependent self construal may prefer to cope in a way that  promotes harmony in relationships    self construal                                                      Chunking is vital for cognition of music  If we had to encode  it in our brains note by note  we d   struggle to make sense of  anything more complex than the simplest children s songs  Of  course  most accomplished musicians can play compositions  containing many thousands of notes entirely from   memory   without a note out of place  But this seemingly awesome  accomplishment of recall is made   improbable by remembering  the musical process  not the individual notes as such  If you ask  a pianist to start a Mozart sonata from bar forty one  she ll  probably have to   mentally replay the music from the start until  reaching that bar   the score is not simply laid out in her mind   to be read from any random point  It s rather like describing how  you drive to work  you don t simply recite the names of roads as  an abstract list  but have to construct your route by mentally  retracing it  When musicians make a mistake during rehearsal   they wind back to the   start of a musical phrase   let s take it  from the second verse   before restarting    chunking               bar                                                     Research with human runners challenged conventional  wisdom and found that the ground reaction forces at the foot  and the shock transmitted up the leg and through the body  after impact with the ground   as runners  moved from extremely compliant to extremely hard running  surfaces  As a result  researchers gradually began to believe  that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness  prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness  or stiffness of the surface on which they are running  This  view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact  forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff  legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain  As a  result  impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly  similar over a wide range of running surface types  Contrary to  popular belief  running on concrete is not more damaging to  the legs than running on soft sand         compliant            terrain       varied little   decreased a lot   suddenly peaked    gradually

example  look again at the old grammar rule  forbidding the splitting of infinitives  After decades of telling  students to never split an infinitive  something just done in  this sentence   most composition experts now acknowledge  that a split infinitive is not a grammar crime  Suppose you  have written a position paper trying to convince your city  council of the need to hire security personnel for the library   and half of the council members   the people you wish to  convince   remember their eighth grade grammar teacher s  warning about splitting infinitives  How will they respond  when you tell them  in your introduction  that librarians are  compelled  to always accompany  visitors to the rare book  room because of the threat of damage  How much of their  attention have you suddenly lost because of their automatic  recollection of what is now a nonrule  It is possible  in other  words  to write correctly and still offend your readers  notions  of your language competence    punctuation          infinitive             reveal your hidden intention   distort the meaning of the sentence   prejudice your audience against you   test your audience s reading comprehension    create fierce debates about your writing topic                                           Even when we do something as apparently simple as picking up  a screwdriver  our brain automatically    We can literally feel things with the end of the screwdriver   When we extend a hand  holding the screwdriver  we  automatically take the length of the latter into account  We can  probe difficult to reach places with its extended end  and  comprehend what we are exploring  Furthermore  we instantly  regard the screwdriver we are holding as  our  screwdriver  and  get possessive about it  We do the same with the much more  complex tools we use  in much more complex situations  The  cars we pilot instantaneously and automatically become  ourselves  Because of this  when someone bangs his fist on  our car s hood after we have irritated him at a crosswalk  we  take it personally  This is not always reasonable  Nonetheless   without the extension of self into machine  it would be  impossible to drive         probe         recalls past experiences of utilizing the tool   recognizes what it can do best without the tool   judges which part of our body can best be used   perceives what limits the tool s functional utility   adjusts what it considers body to include the tool     A large part of what we see is what we expect to see  This  explains why we  see  faces and figures in a flickering  campfire  or in moving clouds  This is why Leonardo da Vinci  advised artists to discover their motifs by staring at patches on  a blank wall  A fire provides a constant flickering change in  visual information that never integrates into anything solid and  thereby allows the brain to engage in a play of hypotheses  On  the other hand  the wall does not present us with very much in  the way of visual clues  and so the brain begins to make more  and more hypotheses and desperately searches for confirmation   A crack in the wall looks a little like the profile of a nose and  suddenly a whole face appears  or a leaping horse  or a  dancing figure  In cases like these the brain s visual strategies  are           flicker         ignoring distracting information unrelated to visual clues    projecting images from within the mind out onto the world   categorizing objects into groups either real or imagined   strengthening connections between objects in the real world   removing the broken or missing parts of an original image                               One of the most widespread  and sadly mistaken  environmental  myths is that living  close to nature  out in the country or in a  leafy suburb is the best  green  lifestyle  Cities  on the other  hand  are often blamed as a major cause of ecological  destruction   artificial  crowded places that suck up precious  resources  Yet  when you look at the facts  nothing could be  farther from the truth    The pattern of life in the country and  most suburbs involves long hours in the automobile each week   burning fuel and pumping out exhaust to get to work  buy  groceries  and take kids to school and activities    City dwellers   on the other hand  have the option of walking or taking transit to  work  shops  and school    The larger yards and houses found  outside cities also create an environmental cost in terms of  energy use  water use  and land use    This illustrates the  tendency that most city dwellers get tired of urban lives and  decide to settle in the countryside    It s clear that the future of  the Earth depends on more people gathering together in compact  communities     compact                                                        Studies of people struggling with major health problems  show that the majority of respondents report they derived  benefits from their adversity  Stressful events sometimes  force people to develop new skills  reevaluate priorities   learn new insights  and acquire new strengths    A  High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health  as  expected  but people who had faced intermediate levels of  adversity were healthier than those who experienced little  adversity  suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can  foster resilience  A follow up study found a similar link  between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects   responses to laboratory stressors   B  Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest  resilience  Thus  having to deal with a moderate amount of  stress may build resilience in the face of future stress    C  In other words  the adaptation process initiated by stress  can lead to personal changes for the better  One study that  measured participants  exposure to thirty seven major  negative events found a curvilinear relationship between  lifetime adversity and mental health     resilience         A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                            The fruit ripening process brings about the softening of  cell walls  sweetening and the production of chemicals that  give colour and flavour  The process is induced by the  production of a plant hormone called ethylene    A  If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with  ethylene production or with the processes that respond to  ethylene  fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe  and full of flavour but would still be in good condition  when it arrived at the supermarket shelf    B  In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene  before sale to the consumer to induce ripening  However   fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit  picked ripe from the plant  Biotechnologists therefore saw  an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening  process in fruit   C  The problem for growers and retailers is that ripening is  followed sometimes quite rapidly by deterioration and  decay and the product becomes worthless  Tomatoes and  other fruits are  therefore  usually picked and transported  when they are unripe         deterioration              A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A

 meetings  and phone  calls   that only distract and confuse her thinking     Clarity is often a difficult thing for a leader to obtain   Concerns of the present tend to seem larger than potentially  greater concerns that lie farther away        Some decisions  by their nature present great complexity  whose many  variables must come together a certain way for the leader to  succeed        Alternatively  the leader s information might  be only fragmentary  which might cause her to fill in the gaps  with assumptions   sometimes without recognizing them as  such        And the merits of a leader s most important  decisions  by their nature  typically are not clear cut         Instead those decisions involve a process of assigning weights  to competing interests  and then determining  based upon  some criterion  which one predominates        The result is  one of judgment  of shades of gray  like saying that Beethoven  is a better composer than Brahms         ergonomist

they also glow to tell bats not to eat them  This twist in the tale  of the trait that gives fireflies their name was discovered by  Jesse Barber and his colleagues  The glow s warning role  benefits both fireflies and bats  because these insects taste  disgusting to the mammals        When swallowed  chemicals  released by fireflies cause bats to throw them back up         The team placed eight bats in a dark room with three or four  fireflies plus three times as many tasty insects  including  beetles and moths  for four days        During the first night   all the bats captured at least one firefly        But by the  fourth night  most bats had learned to avoid fireflies and catch  all the other prey instead        It had long been thought that  firefly bioluminescence mainly acted as a mating signal  but  the new finding explains why firefly larvae also glow despite  being immature for mating    bioluminescence                larvae  larva                                              A     B                     Some environments are more likely to lead to fossilization  and subsequent discovery than others  Thus  we cannot  assume that more fossil evidence from a particular period or  place means that more individuals were present at that time   or in that place  It may just be that the circumstances at one  period of time  or at one location  were more favourable for  fossilization than they were at other times  or in other places   Likewise  the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a  particular time or place does not have the same implication as  its presence  As the saying goes   absence of evidence is not  evidence of absence   Similar logic suggests that taxa are  likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil  record  and they are likely to have survived beyond the time  of their most recent appearance in the fossil record  Thus  the  first appearance datum  and the last appearance datum of  taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative  statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon    subsequent          hominin fossil            taxa  taxon             Since fossilization and fossil

rights of access to water are  associated with the possession of land   until recently in the  Andes  for example  land and water rights were  a  combined  so water rights were transferred with the land  However   through state land reforms and the development of additional  sources of supply  water rights have become separated from  land  and may be sold at auction  This therefore  b  favours  those who can pay  rather than ensuring access to all in the  community  The situation arises  therefore  where individuals  may hold land with no water  In Peru  the government grants  water to communities separately from land  and it is up to  the community to allocate it  Likewise in Yemen  the  traditional allocation was one measure  tasah  of water to one  hundred  libnah  of land  This applied only to traditional  irrigation supplies   from runoff  wells  etc   where a supply  was  c  guaranteed  Water derived from the capture of flash  floods is not subject to Islamic law as this constitutes an  uncertain source  and is therefore free for those able to collect  and use it  However  this traditional allocation per unit of land  has been bypassed  partly by the development of new supplies   but also by the  d  decrease in cultivation of a crop of  substantial economic importance  This crop is harvested  throughout the year and thus requires more than its fair share  of water  The economic status of the crop  e  ensures that water  rights can be bought or bribed away from subsistence crops    irrigation             bribe           subsistence crop

when he opened the envelope that his dad handed to him  He  knew that he would win the essay contest  Overly excited  he  shouted   Hooray   At that moment  two tickets to Ace  Amusement Park  the prize  slipped out of the envelope  He  picked them up and read the letter thoroughly while sitting on  the stairs in front of his house   Wait a minute  That s not my  name    a  he said  puzzled  The letter was addressed to his  classmate Stephanie  who had also participated in the contest   B  Once Steven had heard his dad s words  tears started to fill  up in his eyes   I was foolish   Steven said regretfully  He  took the letter and the prize to school and handed them to  Stephanie  He congratulated her wholeheartedly and she was  thrilled  On the way home after school  his steps were light  and full of joy  That night  his dad was very pleased to hear  what he had done at school    b  I am so proud of you   Steven   he said  Then  without a word  he handed Steven  two Ace Amusement Park tickets and winked   C   If I don t tell Stephanie  perhaps she will never know    Steven thought for a moment  He remembered that the winner  would only be notified by mail  As long as he kept quiet   nobody would know  So he decided to sleep on it  The next  morning  he felt miserable and his dad recognized it right  away   What s wrong   c  Son   asked his dad  Steven was  hesitant at first but soon disclosed his secret  After listening  attentively to the end  his dad advised him to do the right thing   D  Reading on  Steven realized the letter had been delivered  mistakenly   Unfortunately   it should have gone to Stephanie   who was the real winner   d  He looked at the tickets and then  the letter  He had really wanted those tickets  He had planned  to go

wondering what she was working on   She was drawing something that looked like a face  When she  finished it  Jenny shouted   Look  Daddy   She held her artwork  up proudly  Taking a closer look  Nathan recognized that it was  his face  The face had two big eyes and a beard just like his  He  loved Jenny s work  Filled with joy and happiness  Nathan gave  her a big hug     toddler

beyond behavior to see if we can understand the attitudes   beliefs  and values that motivate what we observe  By looking  only at the visible aspects of culture   customs  clothing   food  and language   we develop a short sighted view of  intercultural understanding   just the tip of the iceberg  really   If we are to be successful in our business interactions with  people who have different values and beliefs about how the  world is ordered  then we must go below the surface of what it  means to understand culture and attempt to see what Edward  Hall calls the  hidden dimensions   Those hidden aspects are  the very foundation of culture and are the reason why culture  is actually more than meets the eye  We tend not to notice  those cultural norms until they violate what we consider to be  common sense  good judgment  or the nature of things

far corners of the library                                  You may feel there is something scary about an algorithm  deciding what you might like  Could it mean that  if computers  conclude you won t like something  you will never get the  chance to see it  Personally  I really enjoy being directed  toward new music that I might not have found by myself  I can  quickly get stuck in a rut where I put on the same songs over  and over  That s why I ve always enjoyed the radio  But the  algorithms that are now pushing and pulling me through the  music library are perfectly suited to finding gems that I ll like   My worry originally about such algorithms was that they  might drive everyone into certain parts of the library  leaving  others lacking listeners  Would they cause a convergence of  tastes  But thanks to the nonlinear and chaotic mathematics  usually behind them  this doesn t happen  A small divergence  in my likes compared to yours can send us off into different  far corners of the library    rut           gem         divergence        lead us to music selected to suit our respective tastes   enable us to build connections with other listeners   encourage us to request

of tax legislation are attentive to questions  of economics and history  and less attentive to moral questions   Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative  debate  labeled too controversial  too difficult to answer  or   worst of all  irrelevant to the project  But  in fact  the moral  questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax  laws  Rather than irrelevant  moral questions are fundamental  to the imposition of tax  Tax is the application of a society s  theories of distributive justice  Economics can go a long way  towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a  particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal  but  economics cannot  in a vacuum  identify the goal  Creating tax  policy requires identifying a moral goal  which is a task that  must involve ethics and moral analysis    legislation        imposition

may observe  their own or neighbors  farms  but it is the empirical results they  are using as a guide  not the neighbors themselves  They are  looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such  factors as relative advantage  compatibility with existing  resources  difficulty of use  and  trialability    how well can it  be experimented with  But that criterion of  trialability  turns  out to be a real problem  it s true that farmers are always  experimenting  but working farms are very flawed laboratories   Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional  test plots in research facilities  Farmers also often confront  complex and difficult to observe phenomena that would be  hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments   Moreover farmers can rarely acquire payoff information on  more than a few of the production methods they might use   which makes the criterion of  relative advantage  hard to measure    empirical

psychologists  but also committed  music enthusiasts and experts often voice the opinion that the  beauty of music lies in an expressive deviation from the exactly  defined score  Concert performances become interesting and  gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the  information printed in the score  In his early studies on musical  performance  Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only  rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way  Within the  same metric structure  there is a wide potential of variations in  tempo  volume  tonal quality and intonation  Such variation is  based on the composition but diverges from it individually  We  generally call this  expressivity   This explains why we do not  lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same  piece of music  It also explains why it is worthwhile for  following generations to repeat the same repertoire  New   inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding   which serves to enrich and animate the music scene    deviation        How to Build a Successful Career in Music Criticism   Never the Same  The Value of Variation in Music Performance   The Importance of Personal

Festinger                           Leon Festinger was an American social psychologist  He was  born in New York City in      to a Russian immigrant family   As a graduate student at the University of Iowa  Festinger was  influenced by Kurt Lewin  a leading social psychologist  After  graduating from there  he became a professor at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology in       He later moved to Stanford  University  where he continued his work in social psychology   His theory of social comparison earned him a good reputation   Festinger actively participated in international scholarly  cooperation  In the late     s  he turned his interest to the field  of history  He was one of the most cited psychologists of the  twentieth century  Festinger s theories still play an important

ethics  An ethical issue is an identifiable  problem  situation  or opportunity that requires a person to  choose from among several actions that may   be evaluated as  right or wrong  ethical or unethical    Learn how to choose  from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good  personal values  but also knowledge competence in the business  area of concern  Employees also need to know when to rely on  their organizations  policies and codes of ethics or   have  discussions with co workers or managers on appropriate  conduct  Ethical decision making is not always easy because  there are always gray areas   that create dilemmas  no matter  how decisions are made  For instance  should an employee  report on a co worker engaging in time theft  Should a  salesperson leave out facts about a product s poor safety record  in his presentation to a customer  Such questions require the  decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and  decide   whether to ask for guidance                                                Although the wonders of modern technology have provided  people with opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of our  ancestors  the good  as usual  is weakened by a downside  One  of those downsides is that anyone who so chooses can pick up  the virtual megaphone that is the Internet and put in their two  cents on any of an infinite number of topics  regardless of  their   qualifications  After all  on the Internet  there are no  regulations   preventing a kindergarten teacher from offering  medical advice or a physician from suggesting ways to safely  make structural changes to your home  As a result  misinformation  gets disseminated as information  and it is not always easy to   differentiate the two  This can be particularly frustrating for  scientists  who spend their lives learning how to understand  the intricacies of the world around them  only to have their  work summarily   challenged by people whose experience  with the topic can be measured in minutes  This frustration is  then   diminished by the fact that  to the general public  both  the scientist and the challenger are awarded equal credibility    put in one s two cents             disseminate           intricacy                                                More than just having territories  animals also partition  them  And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for  zoo husbandry  An animal s territory has an internal  arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a  person s house  Most of us assign separate functions to  separate rooms  but even if you look at a one room house  you will find the same internal specialization  In a cabin or  a mud hut  or even a Mesolithic cave from        years ago   this part is for cooking  that part is for sleeping  this part is for  making tools and weaving  that part is for waste  We keep    To a varying extent  other  animals do the same  A part of an animal s territory is for  eating  a part for sleeping  a part for swimming or wallowing   a part may be set aside for waste  depending on the species of  animal    husbandry       an interest in close neighbors   a neat functional organization   a stock of emergency supplies   a distance from potential rivals   a strictly observed daily routine     Fans feel for feeling s own sake  They make meanings  beyond what seems to be on offer  They build identities and  experiences  and make artistic creations of their own to share  with others  A person can be an individual fan  feeling an   idealized connection with a star  strong feelings of memory  and nostalgia   and engaging in activities like  collecting to  develop a sense of self   But  more often  individual  experiences are embedded in social contexts where other  people with shared attachments socialize around the object  of their affections  Much of the pleasure of fandom    In their  diaries  Bostonians of the     s described being part of the  crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance  A  compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less  the object of their fandom than the attachments to  and  differentiations from  one another that those affections afford    embed           compelling        is enhanced by collaborations between global stars   results from frequent personal contact with a star   deepens as fans age together with their idols   comes from being connected to other fans   is heightened by stars  media appearances                                           There was nothing modern about the idea of men making  women s clothes   we saw them doing it for centuries in the  past  In the old days  however  the client was always primary  and her tailor was an obscure craftsman  perhaps talented but  perhaps not  She had her own ideas like any patron  there were  no fashion plates  and the tailor was simply at her service   perhaps with helpful suggestions about what others were  wearing  Beginning in the late nineteenth century  with the  hugely successful rise of the artistic male couturier  it was the  designer who became celebrated  and the client elevated by his  inspired attention  In a climate of admiration for male artists and  their female creations  the dress designer first flourished as the  same sort of creator  Instead of the old rule that dressmaking is a  craft    was  invented that had not been there before         obscure         patron          couturier                a profitable industry driving fast fashion   a widespread respect for marketing skills   a public institution preserving traditional designs   a modern connection between dress design and art   an efficient system for producing affordable clothing     In trying to explain how different disciplines attempt to  understand autobiographical memory the literary critic Daniel  Albright said   Psychology is a garden  literature is a  wilderness   He meant  I believe  that psychology seeks to make  patterns  find regularity  and ultimately impose order on human  experience and behavior  Writers  by contrast  dive into the  unruly  untamed depths of human experiences  What he said  about understanding memory can be extended to our questions  about young children s minds  If we psychologists are too bent  on identifying the orderly pattern  the regularities of children s  minds  we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of  our topic  the child s more unruly and imaginative ways of  talking and thinking  It is not only the developed writer or  literary scholar who seems drawn toward a somewhat wild and  idiosyncratic way of thinking  young children are as well  The  psychologist interested in young children may have to   in  order to get a good picture of how children think         unruly             pervasive               idiosyncratic        venture a little more often into the wilderness   help them recall their most precious memories   better understand the challenges of parental duty   disregard the key characteristics of children s fiction   standardize the paths of their psychological development                              Because plants tend to recover from disasters more quickly  than animals  they are essential to the revitalization of  damaged environments  Why do plants have this preferential  ability to recover from disaster  It is largely because  unlike  animals  they can generate new organs and tissues throughout  their life cycle    This ability is due to the activity of plant  meristems   regions of undifferentiated tissue in roots and  shoots that can  in response to specific cues  differentiate into  new tissues and organs    If meristems are not damaged  during disasters  plants can recover and ultimately transform  the destroyed or barren environment    You can see this  phenomenon on a smaller scale when a tree struck by lightning  forms new branches that grow from the old scar    In the form  of forests and grasslands  plants regulate the cycling of water  and adjust the chemical composition of the atmosphere    In  addition to regeneration or resprouting of plants  disturbed  areas can also recover through reseeding    revitalization                                                       When two natural bodies of water stand at different levels   building a canal between them presents a complicated  engineering problem    A  Then the upper gates open and the ship passes through   For downstream passage  the process works the opposite  way  The ship enters the lock from the upper level  and  water is pumped from the lock until the ship is in line  with the lower level   B  When a vessel is going upstream  the upper gates stay  closed as the ship enters the lock at the lower water level   The downstream gates are then closed and more water is  pumped into the basin  The rising water lifts the vessel to  the level of the upper body of water   C  To make up for the difference in level  engineers build  one or more water  steps   called locks  that carry ships  or boats up or down between the two levels  A lock is an  artificial water basin  It has a long rectangular shape with  concrete walls and a pair of gates at each end    rectangular           A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C

we are far less aware of why we  believe a certain claim to be true  or how we are to  explain why certain social realities exist  Ideas about the  social world become part of our worldview without our  necessarily being aware of the source of the particular  idea or that we even hold the idea at all   B  When we have to offer an account of our actions  we  consciously understand which excuses might prove  acceptable  given the particular circumstances we find  ourselves in  In such situations  we use cultural ideas as  we would use a particular tool   C  We select the cultural notion as we would select a  screwdriver  certain jobs call for a Phillips head while  others require an Allen wrench  Whichever idea we insert  into the conversation to justify our actions  the point is  that our motives are discursively available to us  They are  not hidden         cognizant          discursively          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A

to see any collection of people as  a group        However  social psychologists use this term  more precisely        It is this sense of mutual interaction or  inter dependence for a common purpose which distinguishes  the members of a group from a mere aggregation of  individuals        For example  as Kenneth Hodge observed   a collection of people who happen to go for a swim after work  on the same day each week does not  strictly speaking   constitute a group because these swimmers do not interact  with each other in a structured manner        By contrast   a squad of young competitive swimmers who train every morning  before going to school is a group because they not only share  a common objective  training for competition  but also interact  with each other in formal ways  e g   by warming up together  beforehand         It is this sense of people coming together  to achieve a common objective that defines a  team     exert          aggregation         On top of the hurdles introduced in accessing his or her  money  if a suspected fraud is detected  the account holder  has to deal with the phone call asking if he or she made  the suspicious transactions  Each new wave of technology is intended to enhance user  convenience  as well as improve security  but sometimes these  do not necessarily go hand in hand  For example  the  transition from magnetic stripe to embedded chip slightly  slowed down transactions  sometimes frustrating customers in  a hurry        Make a service too burdensome  and the potential  customer will go elsewhere        This obstacle applies at  several levels        Passwords  double key identification   and biometrics such as fingerprint   iris   and voice recognition  are all ways of keeping the account details hidden from  potential fraudsters  of keeping your data dark        But they  all inevitably add a burden to the use of the account        This  is all useful at some level   indeed  it can be reassuring  knowing that your bank is keeping alert to protect you   but  it becomes tiresome if too many such calls are received         fraud                                        A     B                     A striving to demonstrate individual personality through  designs should not be surprising  Most designers are  educated to work as individuals  and design literature  contains countless references to  the designer   Personal  flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product  categories  particularly relatively small objects  with a low  degree of technological complexity  such as furniture   lighting  small appliances  and housewares  In larger scale  projects  however  even where a strong personality exercises  powerful influence  the fact that substantial numbers of  designers are employed in implementing a concept can  easily be overlooked  The emphasis on individuality is  therefore problematic   rather than actually designing   many successful designer  personalities  function more as  creative managers  A distinction needs to be made between  designers working truly alone and those working in a group   In the latter case  management organization and processes  can be equally as relevant as designers  creativity    strive         flair       Depending on the  A  of a project  the capacity of  designers to  B  team based working environments  can be just as important as their personal qualities   A   B   A   B    size   coordinate   cost  systematize   size   identify   cost  innovate   goal  investigate                                                                   Climate change experts and environmental humanists alike  agree that the climate crisis is  at its core  a crisis of the  imagination and much of the popular imagination is shaped by  fiction  In his      book The Great Derangement  anthropologist  and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between  imagination and environmental management  arguing that  humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part  because fiction  a  fails to believably represent it  Ghosh  explains that climate change is largely absent from  contemporary fiction because the cyclones  floods  and other  catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too  improbable   to belong in stories about everyday life  But climate change  does not only reveal itself as a series of  b  extraordinary  events  In fact  as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel  Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out  environmental change  can be  imperceptible   it proceeds  c  rapidly  only occasionally  producing  explosive and spectacular  events  Most climate  change impacts cannot be observed day to day  but they  become  d  visible when we are confronted with their  accumulated impacts  Climate change evades our imagination because it poses  significant representational challenges  It cannot be observed  in  human time   which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff  Orlowski  who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and  coral reefs  uses  before and after  photographs taken several  months apart in the same place to  e  highlight changes that  occurred gradually

 pounding  It was the second day of their European summer  trip  They were about to visit one of the world s most famous  art galleries  The two of them started hurrying with  excitement  Suddenly  Emilia shouted   Look  There it is   We re finally at the National Gallery   Layla laughed and  responded    a  Your dream s finally come true    B   Don t lose hope yet  Which gallery is the special exhibition  at   Layla asked  Emilia responded   Well  his Sunflowers is  still in England  but it s at a gallery in Liverpool  That s a long  way  isn t it   After a quick search on her phone  Layla stated    No  It s only two hours to Liverpool by train  The next train  leaves in an hour  Why don t we take it   After considering the  idea  Emilia  now relieved  responded   Yeah  but  b  you  always wanted to see Rembrandt s paintings  Let s do that first   Layla  Then  after lunch  we can catch the next train   Layla  smiled brightly   C  However  after searching all the exhibition rooms  Emilia  and Layla couldn t find van Gogh s masterpiece anywhere    That s weird  Van Gogh s Sunflowers should be here  Where  is it   Emilia looked upset  but Layla kept calm and said    Maybe  c  you ve missed a notice about it  Check the  National Gallery app   Emilia checked it quickly  Then  she  sighed   Sunflowers isn t here  It s been lent to a different  gallery for a special exhibition   d  I can t believe I didn t  check    D  Upon entering the National Gallery  Emilia knew exactly  where to go first   e  She grabbed Layla s hand and dragged her  hurriedly to find van Gogh s Sunflowers  It was Emilia s  favorite painting and had inspired her to become a painter   Emilia loved his use of bright colors and light  She couldn t wait  to finally see his masterpiece in person   It ll be amazing to see  how he communicated the feelings of isolation and loneliness in  his work   she said eagerly             A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C

swimming pools for our summer  swim camp  However  due to its popularity  thirty more students  are coming to the camp than we expected  so we need one  more swimming pool for them  The rental section on your  website says that there are two other swimming pools during  the summer season  the Splash Pool and the Rainbow Pool   Please let me know if an additional rental would be possible   Thank you in advance  Best Wishes  Nelson Perkins                                                                                                                                      Jessica                    The island tour bus Jessica was riding on was moving slowly  toward the ocean cliffs  Outside  the sky was getting dark   Jessica sighed with concern   I m going to miss the sunset  because of the traffic   The bus arrived at the cliffs  parking lot   While the other passengers were gathering their bags  Jessica  quickly got off the bus and she ran up the cliff that was famous  for its ocean views  She was about to give up when she got to the  top  Just then she saw the setting sun and it still shone brightly in  the sky  Jessica said to herself   The glow of the sun is so beautiful   It s even better than I expected     worried   delighted   bored   confident   relieved   annoyed   joyful   indifferent   regretful   depressed                                   Consider two athletes who both want to play in college  One  says she has to work very hard and the other uses goal setting to  create a plan to stay on track and work on specific skills where  she is lacking  Both are working hard but only the latter is  working smart  It can be frustrating for athletes to work extremely  hard but not make the progress they wanted  What can make the  difference is drive   utilizing the mental gear to maximize  gains made in the technical and physical areas  Drive provides  direction  goals   sustains effort  motivation   and creates a  training mindset that goes beyond simply working hard  Drive  applies direct force on your physical and technical gears   strengthening and polishing them so they can spin with vigor  and purpose  While desire might make you spin those gears  faster and harder as you work out or practice  drive is what built  them in the first place    vigor

view from nowhere                                   Our view of the world is not given to us from the outside in  a pure  objective form  it is shaped by our mental abilities  our  shared cultural perspectives and our unique values and beliefs   This is not to say that there is no reality outside our minds or  that the world is just an illusion  It is to say that our version of  reality is precisely that  our version  not the version  There is  no single  universal or authoritative version that makes sense   other than as a theoretical construct  We can see the world only  as it appears to us  not  as it truly is   because there is no  as it  truly is  without a perspective to give it form  Philosopher  Thomas Nagel argued that there is no  view from nowhere    since we cannot see the world except from a particular  perspective  and that perspective influences what we see  We  can experience the world only through the human lenses that  make it intelligible to us    illusion       perception of reality affected by subjective views   valuable perspective most people have in mind   particular view adopted by very few people   critical insight that defeats our prejudices   unbiased and objective view of the world                          Often overlooked  but just as important a stakeholder  is the  consumer who plays a large role in the notion of the privacy  paradox  Consumer engagement levels in all manner of digital  experiences and communities have simply exploded   and they  show little or no signs of slowing  There is an awareness among  consumers  not only that their personal data helps to drive the  rich experiences that these companies provide  but also that  sharing this data is the price you pay for these experiences  in  whole or in part  Without a better understanding of the what   when  and why of data collection and use  the consumer is often  left feeling vulnerable and conflicted   I love this restaurant finder  app on my phone  but what happens to my data if I press  ok   when asked if that app can use my current location   Armed  with tools that can provide them options  the consumer moves  from passive bystander to active participant    stakeholder           vulnerable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Considerable work by cultural psychologists and anthropologists  has shown that there are indeed large and sometimes surprising  differences in the words and concepts that different cultures have  for describing emotions  as well as in the social circumstances  that draw out the expression of particular emotions  However   those data do not actually show that different cultures have  different emotions  if we think of emotions as central  neurally  implemented states  As for  say  color vision  they just say that   despite the same internal processing architecture  how we  interpret  categorize  and name emotions varies according to  culture and that we learn in a particular culture the social context  in which it is appropriate to express emotions  However  the  emotional states themselves are likely to be quite invariant  across cultures  In a sense  we can think of a basic  culturally  universal emotion set that is shaped by evolution and implemented  in the brain  but the links between such emotional states and  stimuli  behavior  and other cognitive states are plastic and can  be modified by learning in a specific cultural context    anthropologist          stimuli         cognitive         essential links between emotions and behaviors    culturally constructed representation of emotions

The approach  joint cognitive systems  treats a robot as part of  a human machine team where the intelligence is synergistic   arising from the contributions of each agent  The team consists  of at least one robot and one human and is often called a mixed  team because it is a mixture of human and robot agents   Self driving cars  where a person turns on and off the driving  is  an example of a joint cognitive system  Entertainment robots are  examples of mixed teams as are robots for telecommuting  The  design process concentrates on how the agents will cooperate  and coordinate with each other to accomplish the team goals   Rather than treating robots as peer agents with their own  completely independent agenda  joint cognitive systems  approaches treat robots as helpers such as service animals or sheep  dogs  In joint cognitive system designs  artificial intelligence is  used along with human robot interaction principles to create  robots that can be intelligent enough to be

 His birthplace  Axminster in  Britain  was rich with fossils  and as a child  he naturally became  interested in fossils while collecting them  In       Buckland  won a scholarship and was admitted to Corpus Christi College   Oxford  He developed his scientific knowledge there while  attending John Kidd s lectures on mineralogy and chemistry   After Kidd resigned his position  Buckland was appointed his  successor at the college  Buckland used representative samples  and large scale geological maps in his lectures  which made his  lectures more lively  In       he announced the discovery of the  bones of a giant creature  and he named it Megalosaurus  or   great lizard   He won the prize from the Geological Society  due to his achievements in geology

                                                                Ecosystems differ in composition and extent  They can be  defined as ranging from the communities and interactions of  organisms in your mouth or   those in the canopy of a rain forest  to all those in Earth s oceans  The processes   governing them  differ in complexity and speed  There are systems that turn over  in minutes  and there are others   which rhythmic time  extends to hundreds of years  Some ecosystems are extensive    biomes   such as the African savanna   some cover regions  river  basins   many involve clusters of villages  micro watersheds    others are confined to the level of a single village  the village  pond   In each example there is an element of indivisibility   Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers  and the sum  of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be  lower than the productivity of the whole  other things   being  equal  The mobility of biological populations is a reason  Safe  passages  for example  enable migratory species   to survive    canopy        basin                                                   In recent years urban transport professionals globally have  largely acquiesced to the view that automobile demand in  cities needs to be managed rather than accommodated  Rising  incomes inevitably lead to increases in motorization  Even  without the imperative of climate change  the physical constraints  of densely inhabited cities and the corresponding demands of  accessibility  mobility  safety  air pollution  and urban livability  all   limit the option of expanding road networks purely to  accommodate this rising demand  As a result  as cities develop  and their residents become more prosperous    persuading  people to choose not to use cars becomes an increasingly key  focus of city managers and planners  Improving the quality of   alternative options  such as walking  cycling  and public  transport  is a central element of this strategy  However  the  most direct approach to   accommodating automobile demand  is making motorized travel more expensive or restricting it  with administrative rules  The contribution of motorized travel  to climate change   reinforces this imperative    acquiesce         imperative             constraint                                               Young contemporary artists who employ digital technologies  in their practice rarely make reference to computers  For example   Wade Guyton  an abstractionist who uses a word processing  program and inkjet printers  does not call himself a computer  artist  Moreover  some critics  who admire his work  are little  concerned about his extensive use of computers in the  art making process  This is a marked contrast from three  decades ago when artists who utilized computers were labeled  by critics   often disapprovingly   as computer artists  For the  present generation of artists  the computer  or more appropriately   the laptop  is one in a collection of integrated  portable digital  technologies that link their social and working life  With tablets  and cell phones surpassing personal computers in Internet  usage  and as slim digital devices resemble nothing like the  room sized mainframes and bulky desktop computers of  previous decades  it now appears that the computer artist is  finally      awake   influential   distinct   troublesome    extinct     The critic who wants to write about literature from a formalist  perspective must first be a close and careful reader who examines  all the elements of a text individually and questions how they  come together to create a work of art  Such a reader  who  respects the autonomy of a work  achieves an understanding of it  by    Instead  of examining historical periods  author biographies  or literary  styles  for example  he or she will approach a text with the  assumption that it is a self contained entity and that he or she  is looking for the governing principles that allow the text to  reveal itself  For example  the correspondences between the  characters in James Joyce s short story  Araby  and the people  he knew personally may be interesting  but for the formalist  they are less relevant to understanding how the story creates  meaning than are other kinds of information that the story  contains within itself    entity       putting himself or herself both inside and outside it   finding a middle ground between it and the world   searching for historical realities revealed within it   looking inside it  not outside it or beyond it   exploring its characters  cultural relevance                                           Manufacturers design their innovation processes around  the way they think the process works  The vast majority of  manufacturers still think that product development and service  development are always done by manufacturers  and that  their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to  sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that    Accordingly  manufacturers  have set up market research departments to explore the needs  of users in the target market  product development groups to  think up suitable products to address those needs  and so forth   The needs and prototype solutions of lead users   if  encountered at all   are typically rejected as outliers of no  interest  Indeed  when lead users  innovations do enter a firm s  product line   and they have been shown to be the actual  source of many major innovations for many firms   they  typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic  route         lag       lead users tended to overlook   lead users have already developed   lead users encountered in the market   other firms frequently put into use   both users and firms have valued     Development can get very complicated and fanciful  A  fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process  could go  when a single melodic line  sometimes just a handful  of notes  was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant  work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent  structure  Ludwig van Beethoven s famous Fifth Symphony  provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical  composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping   The opening da da da DUM that everyone has heard somewhere  or another  throughout not only the opening movement  but the remaining   three movements  like a kind of motto or a connective thread   Just as we don t always see the intricate brushwork that goes  into the creation of a painting  we may not always notice how  Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he  develops his material into a large  cohesive statement  But a lot  of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from  the inventiveness behind it  the impressive development of  musical ideas         intricate         coherent           makes the composer s musical ideas contradictory   appears in an incredible variety of ways   provides extensive musical knowledge creatively   remains fairly calm within the structure   becomes deeply associated with one s own enjoyment                              The animal in a conflict between attacking a rival and fleeing  may initially not have sufficient information to enable it to  make a decision straight away    If the rival is likely to win the  fight  then the optimal decision would be to give up immediately  and not risk getting injured    But if the rival is weak and  easily defeatable  then there could be considerable benefit in  going ahead and obtaining the territory  females  food or whatever  is at stake    Animals under normal circumstances maintain a  very constant body weight and they eat and drink enough for  their needs at regular intervals    By taking a little extra time to  collect information about the opponent  the animal is more  likely to reach a decision that maximizes its chances of winning  than if it takes a decision without such information    Many  signals are now seen as having this information gathering or   assessment  function  directly contributing to the mechanism  of the decision making process by supplying vital information  about the likely outcomes of the various options                                                    The fossil record provides evidence of evolution  The  story the fossils tell is one of change  Creatures existed in  the past that are no longer with us  Sequential changes are  found in many fossils showing the change of certain features  over time from a common ancestor  as in the case of the  horse   A  If multicelled organisms were indeed found to have evolved  before single celled organisms  then the theory of evolution  would be rejected  A good scientific theory always allows  for the possibility of rejection  The fact that we have not  found such a case in countless examinations of the fossil  record strengthens the case for evolutionary theory   B  The fossil record supports this prediction  multicelled  organisms are found in layers of earth millions of years  after the first appearance of single celled organisms  Note  that the possibility always remains that the opposite could  be found    C  Apart from demonstrating that evolution did occur  the  fossil record also provides tests of the predictions made  from evolutionary theory  For example  the theory predicts  that single celled organisms evolved before multicelled  organisms     A     C     B

you are invested and have  ownership in something  you overvalue that thing    A  Sometimes  the smartest thing a person can do is quit   Although this is true  it has also become a tired and  played out argument  Sunk cost doesn t always have to be  a bad thing    B  This leads people to continue on paths or pursuits that  should clearly be abandoned  For example  people often  remain in terrible relationships simply because they ve  invested a great deal of themselves into them  Or someone  may continue pouring money into a business that is  clearly a bad idea in the market    C  Actually  you can leverage this human tendency to your  benefit  Like someone invests a great deal of money in a  personal trainer to ensure they follow through on their  commitment  you  too  can invest a great deal up front to  ensure you stay on the path you want to be on         leverage          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                                         Also  it has become difficult for companies to develop new  pesticides  even those that can have major beneficial effects  and few negative effects  Simply maintaining yields at current levels often requires new  cultivars and management methods  since pests and diseases  continue to evolve  and aspects of the chemical  physical  and  social environment can change over several decades        In  the     s  many people considered pesticides to be mainly  beneficial to mankind        Developing new  broadly effective   and persistent pesticides often was considered to be the best way  to control pests on crop plants        Since that time  it has  become apparent that broadly effective pesticides can have  harmful effects on beneficial insects  which can negate their  effects in controlling pests  and that persistent pesticides can  damage non target organisms in the ecosystem  such as birds  and people        Very high costs are involved in following all  of the procedures needed to gain government approval for new  pesticides        Consequently  more consideration is being  given to other ways to manage pests  such as incorporating  greater resistance to pests into cultivars by breeding and using  other biological control methods    pesticide         cultivar         breed           This makes sense from the perspective of information  reliability   The dynamics of collective detection have an interesting  feature  Which cue s  do individuals use as evidence of  predator attack  In some cases  when an individual detects a  predator  its best response is to seek shelter        Departure  from the group may signal danger to nonvigilant animals and  cause what appears to be a coordinated flushing of prey  from the area        Studies on dark eyed juncos  a type of  bird  support the view that nonvigilant animals attend to  departures of individual group mates but that the departure of  multiple individuals causes a greater escape response in the  nonvigilant individuals        If one group member departs   it might have done so for a number of reasons that have little to  do with predation threat        If nonvigilant animals escaped  each time a single member left the group  they would  frequently respond when there was no predator  a false  alarm         On the other hand  when several individuals  depart the group at the same time  a true threat is much more  likely to be present         predator         vigilant           flushing                                          A     B                     Mobilities in transit offer a broad field to be explored by  different disciplines in all faculties  in addition to the  humanities  In spite of increasing acceleration  for example  in travelling through geographical or virtual space  our body  becomes more and more a passive non moving container   which is transported by artefacts or loaded up with inner  feelings of being mobile in the so called information society   Technical mobilities turn human beings into some kind of  terminal creatures  who spend most of their time at rest and  who need to participate in sports in order to balance their  daily disproportion of motion and rest  Have we come  closer to Aristotle s image of God as the immobile mover   when elites exercise their power to move money  things  and people  while they themselves do not need to move at  all  Others  at the bottom of this power  are victims of  mobility structured social exclusion  They cannot decide  how and where to move  but are just moved around or  locked out or even locked in without either the right to  move or the right to stay    In a technology and information society  human beings   whose bodily movement is less   A    appear to  have gained increased mobility and power  and such a  mobility related human condition raises the issue of social   B     A   B   A   B    necessary  inequality   necessary  growth

an emergency  Emergencies are not always clearly  a  labeled  as such   smoke  pouring into a waiting room may be caused  by fire  or it may merely indicate a leak in a steam pipe   Screams in the street may signal an attack or a family quarrel   A man lying in a doorway may be having a coronary   or he  may simply be sleeping off a drunk  A person trying to interpret a situation often looks at those  around him to see how he should react  If everyone else is  calm and indifferent  he will tend to remain so  if everyone  else is reacting strongly  he is likely to become alert  This  tendency is not merely blind conformity  ordinarily we derive  much valuable information about new situations from how  others around us behave  It s a  b  rare traveler who  in  picking a roadside restaurant  chooses to stop at one where  no other cars appear in the parking lot   But occasionally the reactions of others provide  c  accurate  information  The studied nonchalance of patients in a dentist s  waiting room is a poor indication of their inner anxiety  It is  considered embarrassing to  lose your cool  in public  In a  potentially acute situation  then  everyone present will appear  more  d  unconcerned than he is in fact  A crowd can thus  force  e  inaction on its members by implying  through its  passivity  that an event is not an emergency  Any individual  in such a crowd fears that he may appear a fool if he behaves  as though it were    coronary            nonchalance                                    Do We Judge Independently  The Effect of Crowds   Winning Strategy  How Not to Be Fooled by Others   Do Emergencies Affect the Way of Our Thinking    Stepping Towards Harmony with Your Neighbors   Ways of Helping Others in Emergent Situations           a   e

other dorm room at the university  and he became  disappointed  His roommate Steve noticed it and asked what  was wrong  Noah answered quietly that he thought their room  was totally boring   a  He wished the space felt a bit more like  their space  Steve agreed and suggested that they could start  personalizing the room like Noah wanted  the next day   B  As they walked through a furniture store  Steve found a  pretty yellow table  Since he knew that yellow was Noah s  favorite color  Steve asked  b  him what he thought about  buying that table  Noah was happy about the yellow table and  said it would make their room more unique  Delighted  Noah  added   Well  yesterday our room was just like any other  place at this school  But after today   c  I really feel like it ll  be our place   Now  they both knew that the place would  provide them with energy and refreshment   C  Noah hardly slept that night making plans for the room   After Steve woke up  they started to rearrange the furniture   All of the chairs and the sofa in their room were facing the TV   Noah mentioned to Steve that most of their visitors usually just  sat and watched TV instead of chatting  In response to  d  his  idea  Steve suggested   How about we put the sofa over there  by the wall so it will be easier to have conversations   Noah  agreed  and they moved it by the wall   D  After changing the place of the sofa  they could see that  they now had a lot of space in the middle of their room   Then  Noah remembered that his brother Sammy had a big  table in his living room for playing board games and told  Steve about it  Steve and Noah both really enjoyed playing  board games  So  Steve replied to Noah    e  I think putting a  table in the middle of our room would be great for drinking  tea as well as playing board games   Both Noah and Steve  agreed and decided to go shopping for a table              A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C     D

exhibition  The Caroline County Art  Contest has had over one hundred artworks submitted to us by  local artists  For the theme  we wanted artists to explore the  natural world of Caroline County  I believe the Garden Caf   Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event  as your  gallery is well known for its beautiful garden  The exhibition  is usually held throughout October  and we very much hope  that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Caf   Gallery during this time  I look forward to your response   Yours sincerely  Sophia Willis                                                                                                                                 Annette                    The day of the Five Mile Fun Walk had arrived  Annette had  been waiting for Reiner at the registration point for over an hour   There was still no sign of him  She started thinking that  something bad might have happened to him  Getting concerned   she tried calling Reiner s phone again  but there was no  response  At that moment  she heard a voice calling her name   She found Reiner coming toward her   Thank goodness  What  happened   she asked  He explained that the

life  and young children are very much  a part of this multifaceted fabric  The musical experiences they  have provide opportunities for them to know language   behaviors  customs  traditions  beliefs  values  stories  and other  cultural nuances  As they become musically skilled through  experiences in song and instrumental music  young children can  also grow cultural knowledge and sensitivity  Music is an  extremely important aspect of culture  shaping and transmitting  the above mentioned aspects that characterize groups of people   Exposing young children to the world s musical cultures brings  them into the cultural conversation  allowing them to learn about  self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way   Prior to the development of social biases and cultural preferences  that all too easily turn into prejudices  the opportunity to know  people through song  dance  and instrument play is a gift to all  who work for the well balanced development of young children  into the responsible citizens they will one day become    tapestry                       multifaceted

from Plato to Descartes  credits individuals and especially  geniuses with creativity and originality  Social and cultural  influences and causes are minimized  ignored  or eliminated  from consideration at all  Thoughts  original and conventional   are identified with individuals  and the special things that  individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains   The  trick  here is to recognize that individual humans are social  constructions themselves  embodying and reflecting the variety  of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to  during their lives  Our individuality is not denied  but it is viewed  as a product of specific social and cultural experiences  The brain  itself is a social thing  influenced structurally and at the level  of its connectivities by social environments  The  individual   is a legal  religious  and political fiction just as the  I  is a  grammatical illusion     recognition of the social nature inherent in

humbling and perhaps a  calming effect upon the soul of modern man  The nineteenth  century  as we have observed  was the last to believe that the  world  as a whole as well as in its parts  could ever be  perfectly known  We realize now that this is  and always was   impossible  We know within limits  not absolutely  even if the  limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs  Curiously   from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge  and appear to be attainable  Even if we cannot know the world  with absolute precision  we can still control it  Even our  inherently incomplete knowledge seems to work as powerfully  as ever  In short  we may never know precisely how high is the  highest mountain  but we continue to be certain that we can  get to the top

Marc Isambard Brunel                            Marc Isambard Brunel             is best known for the  design and construction of the Thames Tunnel  Originally  born in France  Brunel escaped to the United States during the  French Revolution  He later moved to London  When the  Napoleonic Wars were at their height  he invented machines  for making boots  During the Napoleonic Wars  Brunel s  factory supplied British troops with boots  After the Wars  ended  however  the government stopped buying his boots and  he went out of business  A few years later  Brunel was  imprisoned for several months because of his debt  At that  time  London was very much divided by the River Thames  and needed more ways for people and goods to move across it   In       Brunel designed a tunnel under the river  The Thames  Tunnel officially opened on    March       and Brunel   despite being in ill health  attended the opening ceremony

Competitive activities can be more than just performance  showcases   which the best is recognized and the rest are  overlooked  The provision of timely  constructive feedback to  participants on performance  is an asset that some competitions  and contests offer  In a sense  all competitions give feedback   For many  this is restricted to information about whether the  participant is an award  or prizewinner  The provision of that  type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to  demonstrating superior performance but not   necessarily  excellence  The best competitions promote excellence  not just  winning or  beating  others  The emphasis on superiority is  what we typically see as   fostering a detrimental effect of  competition  Performance feedback requires that the program  go beyond the  win  place  or show  level of feedback   Information about performance can be very helpful  not only  to the participant who does not win or place but also to those  who   do    foster           detrimental                                                    If I say to you   Don t think of a white bear   you will find it  difficult not to think of a white bear  In this way   thought  suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to  suppress instead of calming them   One common example of  this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food  often begin to think much   more about food  This process is  therefore also known as the rebound effect  The   ironic  effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related  cognitive processes  This dual process system involves  first   an intentional operating process  which consciously attempts to  locate thoughts   unrelated to the suppressed ones  Second   and simultaneously  an unconscious monitoring process tests  whether the operating system is functioning effectively  If the  monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the  intended ones  it prompts the intentional operating process to  ensure that these are replaced by   inappropriate thoughts   However  it is argued  the intentional operating system can fail  due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue  stress and  emotional factors  and so the monitoring process filters the  inappropriate thoughts into consciousness  making them  highly   accessible                                             What s in a name  That which we call a rose  by any other  name would smell as sweet   This thought of Shakespeare s  points up a difference between roses and  say  paintings   Natural objects  such as roses  are not   They are  not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages  They belong  to no tradition  strictly speaking have no style  and are not  understood within a framework of culture and convention   Rather  they are sensed and savored relatively directly  without  intellectual mediation  and so what they are called  either  individually or collectively  has little bearing on our experience  of them  What a work of art is titled  on the other hand  has a  significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the  qualities we correctly perceive in it  A painting of a rose  by a  name other than the one it has  might very well smell different   aesthetically speaking  The painting titled Rose of Summer and  an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are  physically  but also semantically and aesthetically  distinct  objects of art    savor           indiscernible               semantically          changed   classified   preserved   controlled   interpreted     Genetic engineering followed by cloning to distribute many  identical animals or plants is sometimes seen as a threat to the  diversity of nature  However  humans have been replacing  diverse natural habitats with artificial monoculture for millennia   Most natural habitats in the advanced nations have already been  replaced with some form of artificial environment based on mass  production or repetition  The real threat to biodiversity is surely  the need to convert ever more of our planet into production  zones to feed the ever increasing human population  The cloning  and transgenic alteration of domestic animals makes little  difference to the overall situation  Conversely  the renewed  interest in genetics has led to a growing awareness that there  are many wild plants and animals with interesting or useful  genetic properties that could be used for a variety of  as yet unknown purposes  This has led in turn to a realization  that       because they may harbor tomorrow s drugs against cancer   malaria  or obesity    monoculture          ecological systems are genetically programmed   we should avoid destroying natural ecosystems   we need to stop creating genetically modified organisms   artificial organisms can survive in natural environments   living things adapt themselves to their physical environments                                           Since human beings are at once both similar and different  they  should be treated equally because of both  Such a view  which  grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of  uniformity and difference  builds difference into the very concept  of equality  breaks the traditional equation of equality with  similarity  and is immune to monist distortion  Once the basis of  equality changes so does its content  Equality involves equal  freedom or opportunity to be different  and treating human beings  equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and  differences  When the latter are not relevant  equality entails  uniform or identical treatment  when they are  it requires  differential treatment  Equal rights do not mean identical rights   for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs  might in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights   Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is  commonly argued  but also full recognition of legitimate and  relevant ones         monist           entail         require different rights to enjoy equality   abandon their own freedom for equality   welcome the identical perception of inequality   accept their place in the social structure more easily   reject relevant differences to gain full understanding     Protopia is a state of becoming  rather than a destination  It  is a process  In the protopian mode  things are better today  than they were yesterday  although only a little better  It is  incremental improvement or mild progress  The  pro  in  protopian stems from the notions of process and progress  This  subtle progress is not dramatic  not exciting  It is easy to miss  because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as  new benefits  The problems of today were caused by  yesterday s technological successes  and the technological  solutions to today s problems will cause the problems of  tomorrow  This circular expansion of both problems and  solutions Ever since the Enlightenment and the invention of science     we ve managed to create a tiny bit more than we ve destroyed  each year  But that few percent positive difference is  compounded over decades into what we might call civilization   Its benefits never star in movies         incremental          compound         conceals the limits of innovations at the present time   makes it difficult to predict the future with confidence   motivates us to quickly achieve a protopian civilization    hides a steady accumulation of small net benefits over time   produces a considerable change in technological successes                              In a highly commercialized setting such as the United  States  it is not surprising that many landscapes are seen as  commodities  In other words  they are valued because of their  market potential  Residents develop an identity in part based  on how the landscape can generate income for the community    This process involves more than the conversion of the  natural elements into commodities    The landscape itself   including the people and their sense of self  takes on the form  of a commodity    Landscape protection in the US traditionally  focuses on protecting areas of wilderness  typically in  mountainous regions    Over time  the landscape identity can  evolve into a sort of  logo  that can be used to sell the stories  of the landscape    Thus  California s  Wine Country    Florida s  Sun Coast   or South Dakota s  Badlands  shape  how both outsiders and residents perceive a place  and these  labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of  those who live there                                                    In the fifth century B C E   the Greek philosopher  Protagoras pronounced   Man is the measure of all things    In other words  we feel entitled to ask the world   What  good are you    A  Abilities  said  to   make  us  human    empathy   communication  grief  toolmaking  and so on   all exist to  varying degrees among other minds sharing the world with  us  Animals with backbones  fishes  amphibians  reptiles   birds  and mammals  all share the same basic skeleton   organs  nervous systems  hormones  and behaviors   B  We assume that we are the world s standard  that all things  should be compared to us  Such an assumption makes us  overlook a lot   C  Just as different models of automobiles each have an  engine  drive train  four wheels  doors  and seats  we  differ mainly in terms of our outside contours and a few  internal tweaks  But like naive car buyers  most people  see only animals  varied exteriors    contour             tweak            A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C

archival institution    A  The best archival decisions about art do not focus on  territoriality  this object belongs in my institution even  though I do not have the resources to care for it  or on  questions of monetary value or prestige  this object raises  the cultural standing of my institution   The best decisions  focus on what evidential value exists and what is best for  the item   B  But art can also carry aesthetic value  which elevates the  job of evaluation into another realm  Aesthetic value and  the notion of artistic beauty are important considerations   but they are not what motivates archival preservation in  the first instance   C  Art can serve as documentary evidence  especially when  the items were produced before photography became  common  Sketches of soldiers on a battlefield  paintings of  English country villages or portraits of Dutch townspeople  can provide the only visual evidence of a long ago place   person or time         archival               prestige             realm        A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A                                                         As long as you do not run out of copies before completing  this process  you will know that you have a sufficient  number to go around    We sometimes solve number problems almost without  realizing it        For example  suppose you are conducting  a meeting and you want to ensure that everyone there has a  copy of the agenda        You can deal with this by labelling  each copy of the handout in turn with the initials of each of  those present        You have then solved this problem  without resorting to arithmetic and without explicit counting         There are numbers at work for us here all the same and  they allow precise comparison of one collection with another   even though the members that make up the collections could  have entirely different characters  as is the case here  where  one set is a collection of people  while the other consists of  pieces of paper        What numbers allow us to do is to  compare the relative size of one set with another    arithmetic         Rather  it evolved naturally as certain devices were found  in practice to be both workable and useful   Film has no grammar        There are  however  some  vaguely defined rules of usage in cinematic language  and the  syntax of film   its systematic arrangement   orders these  rules and indicates relationships among them        As with  written and spoken languages  it is important to remember  that the syntax of film is a result of its usage  not a  determinant of it        There is nothing preordained about  film syntax        Like the syntax of written and spoken  language  the syntax of film is an organic development   descriptive rather than prescriptive  and it has changed  considerably over the years         Hollywood Grammar   may sound laughable now  but during the thirties  forties  and  early fifties it was an accurate model of the way Hollywood  films were constructed         preordained                                            A     B                     Research from the Harwood Institute for Public Innovation  in the USA shows that people feel that  materialism   somehow comes between them and the satisfaction of their  social needs  A report entitled Yearning for Balance  based  on a nationwide survey of Americans  concluded that they  were  deeply ambivalent about wealth and material gain   A  large majority of people wanted society to  move away  from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on  values  community  and family   But they also felt that  these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow  Americans  who  they believed  had become  increasingly  atomized  selfish  and irresponsible   As a result they often  felt isolated  However  the report says  that when brought  together in focus groups to discuss these issues  people  were  surprised and excited to find that others share d  their  views   Rather than uniting us with others in a common  cause  the unease we feel about the loss of social values and  the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is  often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence  which cuts us off from others    ambivalent           Many Americans  believing that materialism keeps them  from  A  social values  feel detached from most  others  but this is actually a fairly  B  concern   A   B   A   B    pursuing    unnecessary   pursuing    common   holding

well crafted text with no expert knowledge  and come away with a good approximation of what has been  intended by the author  The text has become a public document  and the reader can read it with a  a  minimum of effort and  struggle  his experience comes close to what Freud has  described as the deployment of  evenly hovering attention    He puts himself in the author s hands  some have had this  experience with great novelists such as Dickens or Tolstoy  and  he  b  follows where the author leads  The real world has  vanished and the fictive world has taken its place  Now consider  the other extreme  When we come to a badly crafted text in  which context and content are not happily joined  we must  struggle to understand  and our sense of what the author  intended probably bears  c  close correspondence to his  original intention  An out of date translation will give us this  experience  as we read  we must bring the language up to date   and understanding comes only at the price of a fairly intense  struggle with the text  Badly presented content with no frame of  reference can provide  d  the same experience  we see the  words but have no sense of how they are to be taken  The author  who fails to provide the context has  e  mistakenly assumed  that his picture of the world is shared by all his readers and fails  to realize that supplying the right frame of reference is a critical  part of the task of writing    deployment              evenly hovering attention                                           Building a Wall Between Reality and the Fictive World   Creative

 Sally just wanted to get her present and leave the field  because she was starting to get hot and feel irritated   b  She  had only filled her sack twice  but the others were now taking  their third

were bursting  Each child had to  make three trips to the granary  Grandmother was impressed  by their efforts and  d  she wanted to give them presents  accordingly   D  Grandmother asked the other children to do the same thing   Then  all of the children enjoyed their grandmother s delicious  lunch   I am so pleased with your work   she told them after  lunch   This year  you can all take home your final load as a  present   The children cheered for joy  gladly thanked her  and  lifted their sacks to take home  Sally was terribly disappointed   There was nothing but useless corn stalks in

competent in another culture means looking  beyond behavior to see if we can understand the attitudes   beliefs  and values that motivate what we observe  By looking  only at the visible aspects of culture   customs  clothing   food  and language   we develop a short sighted view of  intercultural understanding   just the tip of the iceberg  really   If we are to be successful in our business interactions with  people who have different values and beliefs about how the  world is ordered  then we must go below the surface of what it  means to understand culture and attempt to see what Edward  Hall calls the  hidden dimensions   Those hidden aspects are  the very foundation of culture and are the reason why culture  is actually more than meets the eye  We tend not to notice  those cultural norms until they violate what we consider to be  common sense  good judgment  or the nature of things

send us off into different far corners of the library                                  You may feel there is something scary about an algorithm  deciding what you might like  Could it mean that  if computers  conclude you won t like something  you will never get the  chance to see it  Personally  I really enjoy being directed  toward new music that I might not have found by myself  I can  quickly get stuck in a rut where I put on the same songs over  and over  That s why I ve always enjoyed the radio  But the  algorithms that are now pushing and pulling me through the  music library are perfectly suited to finding gems that I ll like   My worry originally about such algorithms was that they  might drive everyone into certain parts of the library  leaving  others lacking listeners  Would they cause a convergence of  tastes  But thanks to the nonlinear and chaotic mathematics  usually behind them  this doesn t happen  A small divergence  in my likes compared to yours can send us off into different  far corners of the library    rut           gem         divergence        lead us to music selected to suit our respective tastes   enable us to build connections with other listeners   encourage us to request frequent updates for algorithms   motivate us to search for talented but unknown musicians   make us ignore our preferences for particular music genres                          Historically  drafters of tax legislation are attentive to questions  of economics and history  and less attentive to moral questions   Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative  debate  labeled too controversial  too difficult to answer  or   worst of all  irrelevant to the project  But  in fact  the moral  questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax  laws  Rather than irrelevant  moral questions are fundamental  to the imposition of tax  Tax is the application of a society s  theories of distributive justice  Economics can go a long way  towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a  particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal  but  economics cannot  in a vacuum  identify the goal  Creating tax  policy requires identifying a moral goal  which is a task that  must involve ethics and moral analysis    legislation        imposition

payoff  information  They may observe  their own or neighbors  farms  but it is the empirical results they  are using as a guide  not the neighbors themselves  They are  looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such  factors as relative advantage  compatibility with existing  resources  difficulty of use  and  trialability    how well can it  be experimented with  But that criterion of  trialability  turns  out to be a real problem  it s true that farmers are always  experimenting  but working farms are very flawed laboratories   Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional  test plots in research facilities  Farmers also often confront  complex and difficult to observe phenomena that would be  hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments   Moreover farmers can rarely acquire payoff information on  more than a few of the production methods they might use   which makes the criterion of  relative advantage  hard to measure

and psychologists  but also committed  music enthusiasts and experts often voice the opinion that the  beauty of music lies in an expressive deviation from the exactly  defined score  Concert performances become interesting and  gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the  information printed in the score  In his early studies on musical  performance  Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only  rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way  Within the  same metric structure  there is a wide potential of variations in  tempo  volume  tonal quality and intonation  Such variation is  based on the composition but diverges from it individually  We  generally call this  expressivity   This explains why we do not  lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same  piece of music  It also explains why it is worthwhile for  following generations to repeat the same repertoire  New   inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding   which serves to enrich and animate the music scene    deviation        How to Build a Successful Career in Music Criticism   Never the Same  The Value of Variation in Music Performance

student at the University of Iowa  Festinger was  influenced by Kurt Lewin  a leading social psychologist  After  graduating from there  he became a professor at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology in       He later moved to Stanford  University  where he continued his work in social psychology   His theory of social comparison earned him a good reputation   Festinger actively participated in international scholarly  cooperation  In the late     s  he turned his interest to the field  of history  He was one of the most cited psychologists of the  twentieth century

step in  understanding business ethics  An ethical issue is an identifiable  problem  situation  or opportunity that requires a person to  choose from among several actions that may   be evaluated as  right or wrong  ethical or unethical    Learn how to choose  from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good  personal values  but also knowledge competence in the business  area of concern  Employees also need to know when to rely on  their organizations  policies and codes of ethics or   have  discussions with co workers or managers on appropriate  conduct  Ethical decision making is not always easy because  there are always gray areas   that create dilemmas  no matter  how decisions are made  For instance  should an employee  report on a co worker engaging in time theft  Should a  salesperson leave out facts about a product s poor safety record  in his presentation to a customer  Such questions require the  decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and  decide   whether to ask for guidance                                                Although the wonders of modern technology have provided  people with opportunities beyond the wildest dreams of our  ancestors  the good  as usual  is weakened by a downside  One  of those downsides is that anyone who so chooses can pick up  the virtual megaphone that is the Internet and put in their two  cents on any of an infinite number of topics  regardless of  their   qualifications  After all  on the Internet  there are no  regulations   preventing a kindergarten teacher from offering  medical advice or a physician from suggesting ways to safely  make structural changes to your home  As a result  misinformation  gets disseminated as information  and it is not always easy to   differentiate the two  This can be particularly frustrating for  scientists  who spend their lives learning how to understand  the intricacies of the world around them  only to have their  work summarily   challenged by people whose experience  with the topic can be measured in minutes  This frustration is  then   diminished by the fact that  to the general public  both  the scientist and the challenger are awarded equal credibility    put in one s two cents             disseminate           intricacy                                                More than just having territories  animals also partition  them  And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for  zoo husbandry  An animal s territory has an internal  arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a  person s house  Most of us assign separate functions to  separate rooms  but even if you look at a one room house  you will find the same internal specialization  In a cabin or  a mud hut  or even a Mesolithic cave from        years ago   this part is for cooking  that part is for sleeping  this part is for  making tools and weaving  that part is for waste  We keep    To a varying extent  other  animals do the same  A part of an animal s territory is for  eating  a part for sleeping  a part for swimming or wallowing   a part may be set aside for waste  depending on the species of  animal    husbandry       an interest

make meanings  beyond what seems to be on offer  They build identities and  experiences  and make artistic creations of their own to share  with others  A person can be an individual fan  feeling an   idealized connection with a star  strong feelings of memory  and nostalgia   and engaging in activities like  collecting to  develop a sense of self   But  more often  individual  experiences are embedded in social contexts where other  people with shared attachments socialize around the object  of their affections  Much of the pleasure of fandom    In their  diaries  Bostonians of the     s described being part of the  crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance  A  compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less  the object of their fandom than the attachments to  and  differentiations from  one another that those affections afford    embed           compelling        is enhanced by collaborations between global stars   results from frequent personal contact with a star   deepens as fans age together with their idols   comes from being connected to other fans   is heightened by stars  media appearances                                           There was nothing modern about the idea of men making  women s clothes   we saw them doing it for centuries in the  past  In the old days  however  the client was always primary  and her tailor was an obscure craftsman  perhaps talented but  perhaps not  She had her own ideas like any patron  there were  no fashion plates  and the tailor was simply at her service   perhaps with helpful suggestions about what others were  wearing  Beginning in the late nineteenth century  with the  hugely successful rise of the artistic male couturier  it was the  designer who became celebrated  and the client elevated by his  inspired attention  In a climate of admiration for male artists and  their female creations  the dress designer first flourished as the  same sort of creator  Instead of the old rule that dressmaking is a  craft    was  invented that had not been there before         obscure         patron          couturier                a profitable industry driving fast fashion   a widespread

trying to explain how different disciplines attempt to  understand autobiographical memory the literary critic Daniel  Albright said   Psychology is a garden  literature is a  wilderness   He meant  I believe  that psychology seeks to make  patterns  find regularity  and ultimately impose order on human  experience and behavior  Writers  by contrast  dive into the  unruly  untamed depths of human experiences  What he said  about understanding memory can be extended to our questions  about young children s minds  If we psychologists are too bent  on identifying the orderly pattern  the regularities of children s  minds  we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of  our topic  the child s more unruly and imaginative ways of  talking and thinking  It is not only the developed writer or  literary scholar who seems drawn toward a somewhat wild and  idiosyncratic way of thinking  young children are as well  The  psychologist interested in young children may have to   in  order to get a good picture of how children think         unruly             pervasive               idiosyncratic        venture a little more often into the wilderness   help them recall their most precious memories   better understand the challenges of parental duty   disregard the key characteristics of children s fiction   standardize the paths of their psychological development                              Because plants tend to recover from disasters more quickly  than animals  they are essential to the revitalization of  damaged environments  Why do plants have this preferential  ability to recover from disaster  It is largely because  unlike  animals  they can generate new organs and tissues throughout  their life cycle    This ability is due to the activity of plant  meristems   regions of undifferentiated tissue in roots and  shoots that can  in response to specific cues  differentiate into  new tissues and organs    If meristems are not damaged  during disasters  plants can recover and ultimately transform  the destroyed or barren environment    You can see this  phenomenon on a smaller scale when a tree struck by lightning  forms new branches that grow from the old scar    In the form  of forests and grasslands  plants regulate the cycling of water  and adjust the chemical composition of the atmosphere    In  addition to regeneration or resprouting of plants  disturbed  areas can also recover through reseeding    revitalization                                                       When two natural bodies of water stand at different levels   building a canal between them presents a complicated  engineering problem    A  Then the upper gates open and the ship passes through   For downstream passage  the process works the opposite  way  The ship enters the lock from the upper level  and  water is pumped from the lock until the ship is in line  with the lower level   B  When a vessel is going upstream  the upper gates stay  closed as the ship enters the lock at the lower water level   The downstream gates are then closed and more water is  pumped into the basin  The rising water lifts the vessel to  the level of the upper body of water   C  To make up for the difference in level  engineers build  one or more water  steps   called locks  that carry ships  or boats up or down between the two levels  A lock is an  artificial water basin  It has a long rectangular shape with  concrete walls and a pair of gates at each end    rectangular           A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C

we are far less aware of why we  believe a certain claim to be true  or how we are to  explain why certain social realities exist  Ideas about the  social world become part of our worldview without our  necessarily being aware of the source of the particular  idea or that we even hold the idea at all   B  When we have to offer an account of our actions  we  consciously understand which excuses might prove  acceptable  given the particular circumstances we find  ourselves in  In such situations  we use cultural ideas as  we would use a particular tool   C  We select the cultural notion as we would select a  screwdriver  certain jobs call for a Phillips head while  others require an Allen wrench  Whichever idea we insert  into the conversation to justify our actions  the point is  that our motives are discursively available to us  They are  not hidden         cognizant          discursively          A     C     B     B     A     C     B     C     A     C     A     B     C     B     A

to see any collection of people as  a group        However  social psychologists use this term  more precisely        It is this sense of mutual interaction or  inter dependence for a common purpose which distinguishes  the members of a group from a mere aggregation of  individuals        For example  as Kenneth Hodge observed   a collection of people who happen to go for a swim after work  on the same day each week does not  strictly speaking   constitute a group because these swimmers do not interact  with each other in a structured manner        By contrast   a squad of young competitive swimmers who train every morning  before going to school is a group because they not only share  a common objective  training for competition  but also interact  with each other in formal ways  e g   by warming up together  beforehand         It is this sense of people coming together  to achieve a common objective that defines a  team     exert          aggregation         On top of the hurdles introduced in accessing his or her  money  if a suspected fraud is detected  the account holder  has to deal with the phone call asking if he or she made  the suspicious transactions  Each new wave of technology is intended to enhance user  convenience  as well as improve security  but sometimes these  do not necessarily go hand in hand  For example  the  transition from magnetic stripe to embedded chip slightly  slowed down transactions  sometimes frustrating customers in  a hurry        Make a service too burdensome  and the potential  customer will go elsewhere        This obstacle applies at  several levels        Passwords  double key identification   and biometrics such as fingerprint   iris   and voice recognition  are all ways of keeping the account details hidden from  potential fraudsters  of keeping your data dark        But they  all inevitably add a burden to the use of the account        This  is all useful at some level   indeed  it can be reassuring  knowing that your bank is keeping alert to protect you   but  it becomes tiresome if too many such calls are received         fraud                                        A     B                     A striving to demonstrate individual personality through  designs should not be surprising  Most designers are  educated to work as individuals  and design literature  contains countless references to  the designer   Personal  flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product  categories  particularly relatively small objects  with a low  degree of technological complexity  such as furniture   lighting  small appliances  and housewares  In larger scale  projects  however  even where a strong personality exercises  powerful influence  the fact that substantial numbers of  designers are employed in implementing a concept can  easily be overlooked  The emphasis on individuality is  therefore problematic   rather than actually designing   many successful designer  personalities  function more as  creative managers  A distinction needs to be made between  designers working truly alone and those working in a group   In the latter case  management organization and processes  can be equally as relevant as designers  creativity    strive         flair       Depending on the  A  of a project  the capacity of  designers to  B  team based working environments  can be just as

               Climate change experts and environmental humanists alike  agree that the climate crisis is  at its core  a crisis of the  imagination and much of the popular imagination is shaped by  fiction  In his      book The Great Derangement  anthropologist  and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between  imagination and environmental management  arguing that  humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part  because fiction  a  fails to believably represent it  Ghosh  explains that climate change is largely absent from  contemporary fiction because the cyclones  floods  and other  catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too  improbable   to belong in stories about everyday life  But climate change  does not only reveal itself as a series of  b  extraordinary  events  In fact  as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel  Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out  environmental change  can be  imperceptible   it proceeds  c  rapidly  only occasionally  producing  explosive and spectacular  events  Most climate  change impacts cannot be observed day to day  but they  become  d  visible when we are confronted with their  accumulated impacts  Climate change evades our imagination because it poses  significant representational challenges  It cannot be observed  in  human time   which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff  Orlowski  who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and  coral reefs  uses  before and after  photographs taken several  months apart in the same place to  e  highlight changes that  occurred gradually

 pounding  It was the second day of their European summer  trip  They were about to visit one of the world s most famous  art galleries  The two of them started hurrying with  excitement  Suddenly  Emilia shouted   Look  There it is   We re finally at the National Gallery   Layla laughed and  responded    a  Your dream s finally come true    B   Don t lose hope yet  Which gallery is the special exhibition  at   Layla asked  Emilia responded   Well  his Sunflowers is  still in England  but it s at a gallery in Liverpool  That s a long  way  isn t it   After a quick search on her phone  Layla stated    No  It s only two hours to Liverpool by train  The next train  leaves in an hour  Why don t we take it   After considering the  idea  Emilia  now relieved  responded   Yeah  but  b  you  always wanted to see Rembrandt s paintings  Let s do that first   Layla  Then  after lunch  we can catch the next train   Layla  smiled brightly   C  However  after searching all the exhibition rooms  Emilia  and Layla couldn t find van Gogh s masterpiece anywhere    That s weird  Van Gogh s Sunflowers should be here  Where  is it   Emilia looked upset  but Layla kept calm and said    Maybe  c  you ve missed a notice about it  Check the  National Gallery app   Emilia checked it quickly  Then  she  sighed   Sunflowers isn t here  It s been lent to a different  gallery for a special exhibition   d  I can t believe I didn t  check    D  Upon entering the National Gallery  Emilia knew exactly  where to go first   e  She grabbed Layla s hand and dragged her  hurriedly to find van Gogh s Sunflowers  It was Emilia s  favorite painting and had inspired her to become a painter   Emilia loved his use of bright colors and light  She couldn t wait  to finally see his masterpiece in person   It ll be amazing to see  how he communicated the feelings of isolation and loneliness in  his work   she said eagerly             A                                         B     D     C     C     B     D     C
